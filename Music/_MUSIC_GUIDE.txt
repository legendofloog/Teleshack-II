This one should be fairly short. If you have your .s file, 
all you have to do is drag and drop it over s2ea.exe, 
which will spit out a .event, which you should put in the folder. 
Include that event in Music Installer.event, and after that, 
follow the macro to write it to the SongTable. 

SongTable(index,SongPointer,Group)

index is just the ID where the song is in the SongTable. 
The second part in the macro is the label at the end of the .event file,
and the different music groups just indicate priority.
Groups are priority lists, BattleMusicGroup being the highest.
A label is noted by a colon, :, being at the end of it.
You can probably insert the song wherever there's free space
(can check builder to see empty spaces).
