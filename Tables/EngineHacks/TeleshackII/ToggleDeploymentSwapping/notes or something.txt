The first applicable entry in the forced deployment list will be used, so for any unit that's forced deployed for the entire game, exceptions for specific chapters should come earlier in the list before their "default ruling".



In vanilla FE8, 0x332F0 calls 0x9541C to determine how many forced units there are in the chapter. Once done, the game skips that many units in the events' deployement list for displaying the blue squares (where player units can start).
