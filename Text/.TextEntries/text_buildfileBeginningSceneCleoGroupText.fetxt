We've finally made it. Even with Loewe's[N]

information, Duke Cibor's manse has[N]

more powerful defenses than I expected.[AN]

Freeing the general may prove difficult.[A]

[Left]

The fool even got himself captured for[N]

this[Beat] Well, at least his dragon made[N]

it back to us. Thanks to that luck,[AN]

we may still have a chance at rescuing[N]

Dragana. Iskra, Emil, are you sure[N]

you're ready? You're still green.[A]

[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]

Ready as I'll ever be, Mom. You need[N]

everyone you can get, right? Plus,[AN]

I've gotta give Loewe a piece of my[N]

mind for saddling me with this sword.[A]

[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]

Even if our odds are low, we have to[N]

try. Without the general, we never[N]

would have made it this far, right?[A]

[Left]

Indeed. First though, we should[N]

break Loewe out of his cell. We'll need[N]

every capable fighter we can get.[AN]

After that, we'll have to go deeper[N]

into the dungeons to find our general.[A]

[Right]

Mm[Beat] with stealth off the table, every[N]

guard here is coming for our heads.[N]

We must move with haste to succeed.[A]

[Left][TwoLineBox]

Then let us go. Cleo, I expect you to[N]

call the shots from here on out.[AN]

The general entrusted you with strategic[N]

considerations in the main unit, did she not?[A]

[Right]

Yes, Captain Mira. Loewe and[N]

I served as her adjutants.[A]

[Left][ThreeLineBox]

Consider the recon unit at your[N]

disposal, then. Iskra, Emil, I[N]

trust you have no problem with this?[A]

[FarLeft]

No objections. Just use us well,[N]

Cleo. We've lost too many of[N]

our allies to falter here.[A]

[FarRight][TwoLineBox]

Right. All of our hopes are riding on[N]

this mission, so there's no going back.[A]

[Right]

I will do my utmost to match your[N]

expectations. Let us begin the operation![A][X]
