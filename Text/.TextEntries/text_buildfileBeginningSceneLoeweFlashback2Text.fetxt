No[Beat] Mom! Dad![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

[Event]

[MidRight][LoadLoeweKid]

Is anyone here?[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

[Event]

[MidRight][LoadLoeweKid]

If you can hear me, say something![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

[Event]

[MidRight][LoadLoeweKid]

Please[Beat] Don't leave me alone![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

[MidLeft][LoadDragana][ThreeLineBox]

What a dreadful scene[Beat] How did you[N]

manage to survive on your own until[N]

until we found you in the forest?[A]

[MidRight]

I got away. My mom and dad[N]

told me to run[Beat] and I[Beat][N]

I just left them. I'm a coward![A]

[MidLeft]

You're alive, and that's what matters.[N]

The Cytheans razed this place to the[N]

ground, and naught but soil remains.[AN]

Had you stayed, you would have only[N]

died along with the other villagers.[A]

[MidRight]

You don't know that! My mom's real[N]

tough, so I'm sure that they're[N]

still alive. They have to be.[A]

[MidLeft]

It's better if you accept the truth[N]

now. Even after seeing your home in[N]

ashes, you still believe they're safe?[A]

[MidRight][OneLineBox]

[Beat] [Beat][A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]

Do you have any relatives that[N]

can take you in, for now?[A]

[MidRight]

No, I don't. My mom and dad fled here[N]

from Mahemen, so I've got no one else.[A]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]

I see[Beat] in that case, why don't you[N]

come with me? I can offer you food[N]

and shelter, at the very least.[A]

[MidRight]

I have nowhere to go, so just until[N]

I find my parents[Beat] I'll go with you.[N]

Actually, who are you people, anyway?[A]

[MidLeft]

We are the Decian Liberators, those[N]

brave enough to resist the Cythean[N]

occupation of our homeland. As for me,[AN]

I am their leader, Dragana Kasun.[A]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]

Can you teach me how to fight,[N]

then? How to become one of you?[A]

[MidLeft]

It would be many years before I even[N]

consider letting you on a battlefield.[A]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]

Yeah, I figured[Beat] I know I'm weak.[N]

Stil, when I think about what[N]

happened to my home and friends[Beat][AN]

When I think of those dastards[N]

getting away with this, I can't[N]

just wait and watch it happen.[A]

[MidLeft]

[Beat]I'll consider it. For now, we should[N]

escape the flames and head to our base.[N]

Ah, right. What's your name, boy?[A]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]

It's Loewe[Beat] Hold on, I[N]

see something in the rubble.[A]

[Event]

[MidLeft][OneLineBox]

Hm? What is it, Loewe?[A]

[MidRight]

[Beat]A sword. It belonged to my mother.[A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]

I see. Is it too heavy for you to[N]

carry? I can hold on to it for now.[A]

[MidRight]

No, that's fine. Keeping it safe[N]

is up to me now. Let's just go.[A]

[MidLeft][OneLineBox]

[Beat]Right. Follow me, then.[A][X]
