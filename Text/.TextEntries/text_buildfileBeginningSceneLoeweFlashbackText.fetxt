[MidLeft][LoadLoeweMom][OneLineBox]

Loewe! Are you done playing?[A]

[MidRight]

Yeah, all my friends went home.[A]

[MidLeft]

Then it's time for sword practice![A]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]

Do I have to, Mom? It's not like[N]

I need to fight. I'm just a kid.[A]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]

You never know when that may change.[N]

We're safe here in Decia, but[Beat][N]

who knows how long that'll last?[A]

[MidRight][OneLineBox]

Why? Are the Cytheans gonna attack?[A]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]

[Beat]Maybe. They've been preoccupied with[N]

Mahemen recently, though. Your dad and[N]

I barely made it out of there in time.[A]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]

[Beat]So I have to learn to defend myself,[N]

just in case? I guess that makes sense.[A]

[MidLeft]

Good. You have a long way to go before[N]

you can survive with your own strength.[A]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]

You and Dad are here,[N]

so I don't have to, right?[N]

You're not going away?[A]

[MidLeft]

Of course not. Now, back to your[N]

training! If you do well, I'll try to[N]

convince Dad to make your favorite.[A]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]

A-Apple pie?! Alright,[N]

I won't hold anything back![A]

[MidLeft]

Ha, that's the spirit.[N]

Let's see what you've got![A][X]
