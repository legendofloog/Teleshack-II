[MidRight][LoadLoewe]

[MidLeft][LoadSvetomir][OneLineBox]

Hey! Are you ignoring me?[A]

[MidRight]

What do you want?[A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]

Come on, there's no need to be[N]

so cold. We're cell buddies![A]

[MidRight]

Buddy isn't a word I'd use to[N]

describe a pestering priest.[AN]

If you don't need anything,[N]

then leave me alone, got it?[A]

[MidLeft]

Well, you seemed deep in thought, so[N]

I thought you may not have heard it.[A]

[MidRight][OneLineBox]

Heard what?[A]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]

Down the hall, it sounded like weapons[N]

clashing to me. Maybe we've got some[N]

rescuers coming to free us? I hope so.[A]

[MidRight]

Can't imagine any other reason someone[N]

would break into these musty dungeons,[N]

which means she got my message after all.[A]

[MidLeft][OneLineBox]

She? Who is that supposed to be?[A]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]

You'll see soon enough. For now,[N]

get ready to escape if you want[N]

to live to see tomorrow, priest.[A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]

Heh, you don't have to tell me[N]

twice. I'm ready when you are![A][X]
