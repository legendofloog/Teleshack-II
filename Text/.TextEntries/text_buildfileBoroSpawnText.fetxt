There's still a fight going on?[N]

Looks like the Liberators didn't[N]

send their best to save Dragana.[AN]

Only fools would keep fighting for[N]

a cause as sorry and lost as this,[N]

instead of accumulating gold instead.[AN]

Well, I'm not one of them anymore,[N]

so I don't need to hold back.[N]

Can't say I want to kill old comrades,[AN]

but if any of them meet my spear, then[N]

they can only blame their misfortune![A][X]
