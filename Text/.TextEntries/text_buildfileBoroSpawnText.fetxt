There's still a fight going on?[N]
Looks like the Liberators didn't[N]
send their best to save Dragana.[AN]
Only fools would keep fighting for[N]
a cause as sorry and lost as this,[N]
instead of accumulating gold instead.[AN]
Well, I'm not one of them anymore,[N]
so I don't need to hold back.[N]
Can't say I want to kill old comrades,[AN]
but if any of them meet my spear, then[N]
they can only blame their misfortune![A][X]
