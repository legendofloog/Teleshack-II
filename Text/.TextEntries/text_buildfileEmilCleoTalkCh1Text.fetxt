[MidRight][LoadEmil][ThreeLineBox]

Oh, uh, hey there, Cleo! I just[N]

wanted to ask you something.[N]

It'll be quick, I promise.[A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]

Very well. Emil, was it? Ask[N]

away, but please make it quick.[A]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]

Well, is it true that you're from the[N]

Cythean Empire? I'm just curious since[N]

I'm from there too, believe it or not.[A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]

That I am. I didn't expect I'd meet[N]

another deserter. What's your hometown?[A]

[MidRight]

Just a small village close to the[N]

border of Decia. What about you?[A]

[MidLeft][OneLineBox]

I was born in Gechrysos.[A]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]

The capital? Wow, you[N]

must've been rich.[A]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]

I cannot deny it. My family used our[N]

wealth to give me a stellar education[N]

at a military academy in the city.[AN]

They meant to raise me as the perfect,[N]

honorable officer of the Cythean Empire,[N]

just as my elder brother was before me.[AN]

Of course, that didn't turn out well.[A]

[MidRight]

I'd bet you're from a military family,[N]

then. Y'know, a guy from one of those[N]

was the reason I signed up for this war.[AN]

I met the general here, Elias Argymos.[A]

[MidLeft][OneLineBox]

R-Really? How did that happen?[A]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]

One day, he came into my town looking[N]

for recruits. Looking at him was like[N]

seeing a hero from a bedtime story.[AN]

The model Cythean soldier, fighting for[N]

his country[Beat] With a man like that[N]

leading the occupation, it seemed just.[A]

[MidLeft]

[Beat]And then you came here and saw the[N]

truth for your own eyes, as I did.[N]

That we were lied to, about everything.[A]

[MidRight]

Yeah[Beat] I'd only trained for a week[N]

before I defected from my squad.[N]

They chased me down, but thankfully,[AN]

Mira and the recon unit saved me.[N]

How did you end up on this side?[A]

[MidLeft]

I received a commissioned position[N]

based off of my family name, mostly.[N]

For a time, I followed my orders,[AN]

but the guilt became too much to bear.[AN]

When I came across General Dragana,[N]

I surrendered immediately to her,[N]

expecting I'd soon meet my death.[AN]

Instead, she let me live. I mean to[N]

repay that mercy in any way that I can.[A]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]

That's all we can do now[Beat] Sorry, that[N]

ended up taking longer than I thought.[A]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]

Yes, we should focus on the mission.[N]

However, it was helpful, discussing[N]

this with someone else who understands.[A]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]

Agreed. Well, I'll go on ahead, Cleo.[N]

Maybe we can talk some other time![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]

Argymos[Beat] So Emil met my brother?[N]

If I continue on this path, then[N]

I may have to see him again soon[Beat][A][X]
