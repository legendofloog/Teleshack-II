[MidRight][LoadDragana]

Cidor[Beat] What do you want? I've[N]

no patience for traitorous swine.[A]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]

Now, now. There is no need for harsh[N]

words, General Dragana. I simply came[N]

to inform you of your execution.[AN]

It will occur tomorrow, as planned.[A]

[MidRight]

Why not end me right here[N]

if you're that anxious?[N]

The waiting's killing me.[A]

[MidLeft]

I have no plans to do it personally.[N]

Besides, it must be public in order to[N]

properly crush your band's spirits.[A]

[MidRight]

Yet you felt the need to tell me[N]

yourself. I doubt you came here[N]

just to gloat about your victory.[AN]

Well, maybe you really wanted to hear[N]

stories about an old flame. Mira's[N]

doing quite well, no thanks to you.[A]

[MidLeft][OneLineBox]

[Beat]I'm glad that is the case.[A]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]

Your daughter is best off of all,[N]

not knowing her father is a[N]

traitor to her own country.[A]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]

You may see me as a traitor, but I will[N]

do what I must to protect my land and[N]

my people. Now, is there anything else?[A]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]

Well, I have more, but if you tire[N]

of it, then just one question.[AN]

Didn't Boro's betrayal hinge on you[N]

not killing any of us unnecessarily?[A]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]

So he told you that much. Indeed,[N]

it did. I found it odd that a man[N]

throwing you all to the wolves cared,[AN]

but I humored his request. However,[N]

your death alone is necessary if[N]

the rebellion is to stay weak.[A]

[MidRight]

Is that so? I'd watch out if I were[N]

you. Angering Boro is likely to end[N]

with a spear in your back, Cidor.[A]

[MidLeft]

I will take my chances. The man has[N]

proven he valued money over your cause,[N]

and I cannot afford to let you recover.[AN]

With the Liberators finally defeated,[N]

your benefactors now lack their shield.[N]

I must capitalize on this good fortune.[A]

[MidRight]

Ha, good luck with that. You don't even[N]

know where House Freyse's nobility are,[N]

right? Besides, if you think we're done,[AN]

then you're not paying attention. Even[N]

if I fall here, they can continue on.[A]

[MidLeft]

[Beat]My offer still stands, Dragana. If[N]

you tell me where the surviving heir is,[N]

I will allow you to keep your head.[A]

[MidRight]

No thanks. Even if I'm not their knight[N]

anymore, I still have the pride of one.[N]

You're not getting anything from me.[A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]

Very well, you've made yourself clear.[N]

Spend your final hours wisely, general.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

[MidRight][ClearFace]

[Event]

[MidRight][LoadDragana][ThreeLineBox]

Heh[Beat] Since they went on the run, I[N]

haven't heard anything from them.[N]

Couldn't tell him even if I wanted to.[AN]

I wonder how everyone else is doing.[N]

At the very least, Mira should be safe,[N]

and some of us escaped their ambush.[AN]

[Beat]I hope Loewe and Cleo are alright,[N]

at least. If they keep living, then[N]

I'm certain that we still have hope.[A][X]
