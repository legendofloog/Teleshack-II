I don't hear any pursuers[Beat] It[N]

appears that we're safe, for now.[A]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]

Not for long, I'd bet. Those dogs will[N]

follow any order from their master,[N]

no matter how long it takes them.[A]

[MidRight]

Indeed. Even for a vassal of Cythes,[N]

House Selise seems particularly[N]

devoted to maintaining the occupation.[A]

[MidLeft]

Can't say I'm surprised. Duke Cidor[N]

threw away his pride the moment he[N]

let the Cytheans in unchallenged.[AN]

All that's left for him now is[N]

licking General Argymos's boot.[A]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]

[Beat]Perhaps. I doubt he would[N]

want Cidor doing that, though.[A]

[MidLeft][OneLineBox]

Huh? What was that, Cleo?[A]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]

Oh, nothing. We should start moving[N]

before our enemies continue their[N]

pursuit. General Dragana awaits us.[A]

[MidLeft][OneLineBox]

[Beat]Right. Let's keep moving.[A][X]
