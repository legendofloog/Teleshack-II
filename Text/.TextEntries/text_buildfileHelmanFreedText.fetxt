Harumph! Never expected a bunch of[N]
youngsters to come to my aid. That[N]
damnable duke threw me in here,[AN]
all because I didn't pay my taxes.[N]
To that, I say phooey! A dog of the[N]
Cythean Empire deserves only scorn.[AN]
Oh, you agree? Well, if you ever find[N]
yourself in Vetheim, some of my family[N]
live there. Tell 'em Helman sent you,[AN]
and they may just help you out.[A][X]
