Harumph! Never expected a bunch of[N]

youngsters to come to my aid. That[N]

damnable duke threw me in here,[AN]

all because I didn't pay my taxes.[N]

To that, I say phooey! A dog of the[N]

Cythean Empire deserves only scorn.[AN]

Oh, you agree? Well, if you ever find[N]

yourself in Vetheim, some of my family[N]

live there. Tell 'em Helman sent you,[AN]

and they may just help you out.[A][X]
