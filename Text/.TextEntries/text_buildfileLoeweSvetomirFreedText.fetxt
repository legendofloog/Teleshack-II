[Right][LoadLoewe]

[MidLeft][LoadCleo][OneLineBox]

Loewe! I'm glad you're alright.[A]

[Right][TwoLineBox]

They roughed me up a bit, but[N]

I'll survive. Where's Lumi?[A]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]

Some members of the recon unit are[N]

watching over our mounts, so she's[N]

with them. Here, I brought you a bow.[A]

[Right]

Thanks. By the way, did you find out[N]

where Dragana is? The guards wouldn't[N]

say a word about it when I asked.[A]

[MidLeft]

From the few we've interrogated, she's[N]

deeper in the dungeons. I couldn't[N]

find her exact location, however.[A]

[Right]

Then we have to get a move on, quickly.[N]

If it comes to it, we may need to leave[N]

behind some of our allies, as well.[A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]

What are you saying? How are we[N]

supposed to continue on without them?[A]

[Right][ThreeLineBox]

It would be difficult, but if we have[N]

no other choice, then [Red]at least the two[N]

of us have to live to see another day.[Red][AN]

Rescuing Dragana is our top priority,[N]

and we can't afford to fail, Cleo.[A]

[MidLeft]

It won't come to that.[Red] I'll make sure[N]

everyone else escapes before us.[Red][N]

That way, no one will be captured.[A]

[Right][TwoLineBox]

I hope it does go that easily. Still,[N]

we have to be prepared for anything.[A]

[FarRight][LoadSvetomir]

Uh, hello there. Sorry to butt in, but[N]

are you two a part of the resistance?[AN]

[MidLeft][OneLineBox]

That we are. And who are you?[A]

[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]

I'm Svetomir, a priest of Vetheim, a[N]

town at the foot of the duke's manse.[N]

I organized a protest against him,[AN]

but he threw me and my fellows in[N]

prison the moment he found out.[N]

You have my thanks for freeing me.[A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]

Well, you're safe now. You should[N]

leave while you still can, priest.[A]

[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]

Wait! I'm a fairly capable healer.[N]

If you let me join you and give me[N]

a staff, I can mend your wounds.[A]

[MidLeft][OneLineBox]

You mean to become one of us?[A]

[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]

I've spent my days hoping Byelen would[N]

hear my prayers[Beat] That he would strike[N]

down the invaders and save our country.[AN]

However, I now understand his answer.[N]

I must take matters into my own hands.[N]

If it'll help you chase out the Cytheans,[AN]

then I'll do anything you need![A]

[MidLeft]

Well[Beat] it's your life. If you wish to[N]

spend it for our cause, then I've no[N]

objections. What about you, Loewe?[A]

[Right]

Fine by me. Svetomir seems useful,[N]

and he already has the spirit.[N]

Just don't fall behind, got it?[A]

[FarRight][OneLineBox]

I wouldn't dream of it![A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]

Then I'll give you this staff.[N]

Put it to good use, Svetomir.[A]

[FarRight][OneLineBox]

Of course. You can count on me![A][X]
