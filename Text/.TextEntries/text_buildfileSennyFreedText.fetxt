You're freeing me? Oh, thank you so[N]
much! They threw me in here for taking[N]
part in Father Svetomir's protest.[AN]
He always does so much for us, watching[N]
over the children, but even still[Beat][N]
Why did I think that was a good idea?[AN]
Anyway, I'd better leave before the[N]
guards catch up. If we meet again,[N]
I'll thank you properly, alright?[AN]
Okay, I'd better get moving. Stay safe![A][X]
