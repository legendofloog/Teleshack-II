You're freeing me? Oh, thank you so[N]

much! They threw me in here for taking[N]

part in Father Svetomir's protest.[AN]

He always does so much for us, watching[N]

over the children, but even still[Beat][N]

Why did I think that was a good idea?[AN]

Anyway, I'd better leave before the[N]

guards catch up. If we meet again,[N]

I'll thank you properly, alright?[AN]

Okay, I'd better get moving. Stay safe![A][X]
