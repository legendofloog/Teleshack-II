If you say so, Elise. Wasn't true[N]
the last ten times we did this, though.[A][ToggleSmile]
[FarLeft]
Better take us serious, Loewe.[N]
I'm not ready to give up yet![A]

Me neither. We have to get at least[N]
one win, or I'll never live it down.[A]

Of course, they could never last.[AN]
Not when the Cytheans hungered[N]

Loewe! Are you done playing?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Yeah, all my friends went home.[N]
I won again, as usual, heh.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You know the forest well by now, I see.[N]
No doubt the fruits of your training.[N]
Speaking of[Beat] are you ready?[A]
[MidRight]
Ugh, do I have to, Mom? It's not like[N]
I need to know how to use a sword[N]
when we're living in a town like this.[A]
[MidLeft]
Well, you should know how to defend[N]
yourself, but that's not what I meant.[N]
It's time for your lessons, Loewe.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Hey, isn't Dad supposed to do that?[N]
What gives? He's a nicer teacher.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Your father's busy making a nice[N]
treat for you.[A] But if he hears that[N]
you're not taking your education[N]
seriously[Beat] Are we clear, Loewe?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Y-Yes, Mom! I'll pay attention,[N]
honest. What's the subject?[A][X]

## BeginningSceneLoeweHistoryLesson
[MidLeft][LoadCatrinYoung]
[MidRight][LoadLoeweYoung]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Geography. Let's start with a warm-up,[N]
Loewe, just to make sure you remember[N]
the last lesson. Take a look here.[AN]
Where are we right now on the map?[A]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][TwoLineBox]
Oh, come on! That's easy.[N]
We're in Decia, right[Beat] here![AN][CSS]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[Event]
[MidLeft][LoadCatrinYoung]
[MidRight][LoadLoeweYoung]
There're lots of mountains and forests,[N]
and good food and people, too.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][ThreeLineBox]
Indeed. The mountains split the country[N]
into two regions, each ruled separately.[AN]
House Selese governs the north, where we[N]
are, while House Freyse governs the south.[AN]
But yes, we came here because Decia[N]
is a land of plenty. Do you remember[N]
where we all lived, originally?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Uh[Beat] Mahemen's over here, right?[AN][CSS]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[Event]
[MidLeft][LoadCatrinYoung]
[MidRight][LoadLoeweYoung]
Mm[Beat] It used to be a nice place,[N]
right? Why did we leave, again?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Another country invaded our home,[N]
and your father and I thought it best[N]
that we raise you in safer lands.[AN]
Although Mahemen still maintains[N]
some of its power, it's hard to say[N]
how much longer they'll hold out[Beat][AN]
As it stands, Cythes, our shared[N]
northern neighbor, will conquer[N]
them before long. It's a shame.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
The Cythean Empire[Beat][A][CSS]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[Event]
[MidLeft][LoadCatrinYoung]
[MidRight][LoadLoeweYoung][ThreeLineBox]
Seems like a bad place, if they're going[N]
around invading people who didn't do[N]
anything to them. Though[Beat] Say, Mom.[AN]
How come they haven't done the[N]
same to us, if they're so strong?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Who can say? Perhaps they think[N]
that fighting a war on two fronts[N]
could lead to them winning neither.[AN]
Still, it's good to think ahead,[N]
Loewe. We must always stay ready,[N]
in case they change their mind.[AN]
The nobles of House Selese protect us,[N]
for now, but that may not always last.[AN]
[Beat]Now, for the last country, at the[N]
bottom. I spent some time here myself,[N]
as a mercenary. What is it called?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Ah man, I always forget this one[Beat][N]
It's uh[Beat] Uh[Beat] Chouwouj! That's it![AN][CSS]

[MidRight][LoadLoeweYoung]
There're lots of jungles, and kings,[N]
and[Beat] I don't remember anything else.[A]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][ThreeLineBox]
Well, good enough. Yes, while scholars[N]
debate whether it truly counts as[N]
part of the continent of Orodreth,[AN]
they're undoubtedly our neighbors,[N]
land route or no. Now, with that[N]
out of the way, let's go into detail-[AN]

Please, Mom[Beat] Can that be it for now?[AN]
I'm hungry, and I can't learn if[N]
my stomach's growling the whole time.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm[Beat] Well, I suppose it's difficult[N]
to learn on an empty stomach, yes.[AN]
We can take a break and come back[N]
to it later. Just know, Loewe[Beat][AN]
Everything we're teaching you[N]
is something you'll need one day.[AN]
Take it seriously while we're here[N]
because one day, we won't be.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadLoeweYoung]
But not any day soon, right?[N]
You'll be here for a long time?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Of course, Loewe.[N]
Now, let's go in and eat.[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadDraganaYoung][ThreeLineBox]
You're lucky you were in the forest,[N]
or you too would have met the Cytheans.[N]
Why were you away from Linoras, lad?[A]
[MidRight]
My mom and dad told me to run[Beat][N]
and I[Beat] I just left them.[N]
And now[Beat] We're separated[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
You're alive, and that's what matters.[N]
Had you stayed, you would have only[N]
died along with the other villagers.[A]
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
You don't know that they're dead![N]
My mom's real tough, so my parents[Beat][N]
They're still alive. They have to be.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]You still believe they're safe?[AN]
Even after seeing this destruction,[N]
you think that they've survived?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] [Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Well, I hope that you're right.[N]
Do you have any relatives that can[N]
take you in until you find them?[A]
[MidRight]
No, I don't. We all fled here[N]
from Mahemen, across the sea.[N]
I don't know any other family.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I see[Beat] In that case, why not[N]
come with me? I can offer you food[N]
and shelter, at the very least.[A]
[MidRight][LoadLoeweYoung]
[Beat]That'd be real nice, lady,[N]
but first, who are you people?[N]
I've never seen you around town.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
We're the Decian Liberators, those[N]
brave enough to resist the impending[N]
Cythean invasion of our homeland.[AN]
I'm their leader, Dragana Kasun.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Can you teach me how to fight,[N]
then? How to become one of you?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I could show you how to use a bow, but[Beat][N]
It would be many years before I even[N]
consider letting you on a battlefield.[A]
[MidRight]
Yeah, I figured[Beat] I know I'm weak.[N]
Still, when I think about what[N]
happened to my home and friends[Beat][AN]
When I think of those people[N]
getting away with this, I can't[N]
just sit around and watch it happen.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I'll think about it, but for now,[N]
we should leave and head to our base.[AN]
Ah, right. What's your name, boy?[A]

My mother's sword, but[Beat][N]
Why's it still here?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That's a question you can ask later.[N]
Is it too heavy for you to carry?[N]
I can hold on to it for you.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
No, I'll keep it with me.[N]
It's my responsibility now.[A]

Come on, there's no need to be[N]
so cold. We're cell buddies![A]

Buddy isn't a word I'd use to[N]
describe a pestering priest.[AN]
If you don't need anything,[N]
then leave me alone, got it?[A]

Someone woke up on the wrong side[N]
of the bed, eh? Well, you seemed deep[N]
in thought, so you must not have heard.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Heard what?[A]

Down the hall, it sounded like weapons[N]
were clashing. Maybe some rescuers are[N]
coming to free us? I hope so, anyway.[A]

Can't imagine any other reason someone[N]
would break into these musty dungeons,[N]
which means she got my message after all.[A]

We've finally made it. Even with Loewe's[N]
information, Duke Cidor's manse has[N]
more powerful defenses than I expected.[AN]
[Left]
The fool got himself captured for it[Beat][N]
Well, at least his dragon made it back[N]
with the message he risked his life for.[AN]
Thanks to that luck, we may still have[N]
a chance at rescuing Kasun. Iskra,[N]
Emil, are you sure you're ready?[AN]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Ready as I'll ever be, Mom. You need[N]
everyone you can get, right? Plus,[AN]
I've gotta give Loewe a piece of my[N]
mind for saddling me with this sword.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Even if our odds are low, we have to[N]
try. Without General Dragana, we never[N]
would have made it this far, right?[AN]
I'm not sure how she got outmaneuvered,[N]
but we gotta do all we can to help her![A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Indeed. First though, we should[N]
break Loewe out of his cell quickly.[AN]
After that, we'll have to go deeper[N]
into the dungeons to find Kasun.[A]
[Right]
Mm[Beat] with stealth off the table,[N]
every guard here will come for our heads.[AN]
We must move with haste to succeed.[A]
[Left]
Nothing new there. Cleo, I expect you[N]
to call the shots from here on out.[AN]
Kasun entrusted you with strategic[N]
counsel in the main unit, didn't she?[A]
[Right]
Yes, Captain Mira. Loewe and I[N]
have served as her adjutants.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Consider the recon unit at your[N]
disposal, then. I trust that[N]
you two have no problem with this?[A]
[FarLeft]
None at all. Just use us well,[N]
Cleo. We've lost too many of[N]
our allies to falter here.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Right. All of our hopes are riding on[N]
this mission, so there's no going back.[A]
[Right]
I will do my utmost to live up to your[N]
hopes[Beat] Let's begin the operation![A][X]

## Chapter1MiraCaptureText
[MidLeft][LoadMira]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft]
Ah, I forgot to mention something,[AN]
Cleo. As you can see, we'll likely[N]
come across many locks down here.[AN]
I can pick them well enough myself,[N]
but I can't be everywhere at once.[AN]
[MidRight]
Dungeons are so unpleasant[Beat][N]
Well, what do you suggest, then?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Something simple enough. The cell[N]
guards have those dangling keys,[N]
right? All we have to do is take them.[AN]
I can [Red]steal[Red] some, along with anything[N]
else light enough for me to carry,[N]
but there's another way to get them.[AN]
Instead of killing an enemy, sometimes[N]
it's better to [Red]capture[Red] them and take[N]
everything but the shirt off their back.[AN]
[MidRight]
And let them go when we're done?[N]
Hm[Beat] Well, it'd be easier to carry[N]
enemies if I had my pegasus,[AN]
but the soldiers seem light enough[N]
for me to subdue, at the very least.[N]
Thank you for the advice, Mira.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Think nothing of it.[N]
Now, let's get back to work![A][X]

## Chapter1CaptureStealTutorialBox
You can take items and weapons from[N]
the enemy by using Capture and Steal.[AN]
Steal can be used on any item so long[N]
as the thief has more Bld than the[N]
item's Wt. Capture is done via combat.[AN]
If the allied unit has more Build than[N]
the enemy, they can Capture when[N]
attacking that enemy at 1 Range.[AN]
Mounted units skip this requirement[N]
and are able to capture any unit,[N]
except for those with 20 Build.[AN]
Outside of enemies with the Watchful[N]
skill, these can be used on any enemy.[AN]
so take what you can when you can![A][X]

## Chapter1EquipTutorialBox
Certain items are equippable[N]
as accessories. These give[N]
varying effects unique to each,[AN]
such as stat bonuses or skills.[AN]
Items can be equipped and[N]
unequipped in the Item menu[N]
when moving any player unit.[A][X]

## CheckTheGuide
Hello! Thank you for playing[N]
Bells of Byelen. This hack[N]
includes many new mechanics,[AN]
most coming from FE5, so if[N]

or confused about how they work,[AN]
please refer to the Guide in[N]
the map menu. Otherwise,[N]
we hope you enjoy the game![AN]

## Chapter1EscapeTutorialBox
All units try to Escape to the flashing[N]
tiles that correspond to their[N]
color (red units to red tiles, etc).[AN]
On Escape maps, Cleo, Loewe, and[N]
sometimes others must Escape to[N]
the blue tiles to beat the map.[AN]
However, any allied unit left[N]
behind will be lost forever,[N]
so try to have everyone Escape![A][X]

Do you hear that, Alena? Looks like[N]
the fighting's gotten underway.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Seems so. Well, you know the score.[N]
The duke's paying us plenty for this[N]
job, so we'll have to earn our keep.[AN]
Let's wait just a bit longer to make[N]
our move. With any luck, the regular[N]
guards'll soften the rebels up for us.[A]
[Right]
You got it, boss. A day's work in[N]

down after that[Beat] what a nuisance.[A][X]

## AlenaChargeText

## LastBoroWarningText
[MidRight][LoadCleo][ThreeLineBox]
That noise coming from behind us[Beat][AN]
Some of the guards were whispering[N]
about a man named "Boro", praying[N]
that he'd run us through with his spear.[AN]
[Beat]I'd hoped reports of his betrayal[N]
were false, but if he's coming after us,[N]
then we can't waste any more time here![A][X]

## BoroSpawnText
[MidRight][LoadBoro][ThreeLineBox]
There's still a fight going on?[AN]
Looks like the Liberators didn't[N]
send their best to save Dragana.[N]
Well, can't say I'm too surprised.[AN]
Decia's been under the boots of those[N]
imperial bastards for ten years now[Beat][N]
Any liberation we hoped for is dead.[AN]
Better to live as a well-fed hound[N]
of Cidor than die along with it[Beat][N]
Whatever. My job here is clear.[AN]
Anyone who won't fight is no enemy[N]
of mine, but if they try to resist,[N]
then my spear will run them through![A][X]

Iskra, I'm glad you're safe.[N]
Do you still have my sword?[A]

[MidRight][OneLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Thanks. I knew I could count on you.[A][ToggleSmile]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I don't want your gratitude, Loewe.[N]
Just don't make another plan risky[N]
enough where you'd need to do this.[AN]
[MidRight]
Sorry, but I can't promise anything.[N]
I'll do what I must to free Dragana,[N]
even if it means risking everything.[AN][LoadLoeweAngry]
It's thanks to her that I'm here,[N]
so I can't let Cidor do this to her![A]
[MidLeft]
We all want to save the general,[N]
but we need all the leadership we[N]
can get our hands on in her absence.[AN]
That includes you, as her adjutant.[N]
Tell me that you won't die like a fool,[N]
or I'm not giving the sword back.[A]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe][OneLineBox]
[Beat]You know how to twist my arm.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Of course. I've learned[N]
that much over the years.[A][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]
Fine, I won't take any unnecessary[N]
risks. Is that good enough for you?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I suppose it'll do. Here, take it.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Finally! Feels good to have[N]
this back in my hands. Now, let's-[A]
[MidLeft]
Hold on. If you don't mind me asking[Beat][N]
Can you teach me how to use a sword?[AN]
I want to be able to defend myself.[N]
even if I'm unable to use my magic.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You sure you should ask me? What little[N]
I know comes from my mother, but she[N]
died before I learned much of anything.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I've seen you practicing on[N]
your own sometimes, though.[N]
You look pretty good to me.[A]
[MidRight]
Maybe to an amateur, but a real[N]
Mahemeni swordmaster's movements[N]
blur together at ridiculous speed.[AN]
As for me? I can barely swing a sword[N]
at a person, let alone manage that.[AN]
It'd be different if a swordmaster there[N]
could finish my training, but for now,[N]
my swordsmanship is of use to no one.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Hm[Beat] What's holding you back[N]
from using a sword in the field?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
When I'm facing a real person with one,[N]
there's a[Beat] sense of hesitation.[AN]
I can barely ignore it in spars, let[N]
alone a real battle. Still, if you want[N]
to learn, then I can show you a bit.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Ha, I'm glad to hear it. Wouldn't[N]
want to twist your other arm too.[A][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]
Yeah, yeah, get moving. We've[N]
wasted enough time talking, Iskra.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

They roughed me up a bit, but[N]
I'll survive. Where's Lumi?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Your wyvern? Some members of the recon[N]
unit have her and our other mounts.[N]
I brought you a bow. Ready to fight?[A]
[Right]
As always. Did you find out where[N]
they're keeping Dragana? The guards[N]
wouldn't say a word about it, of course.[A]
[MidLeft]
From the few we've interrogated, she's[N]
deeper in the dungeons. I couldn't[N]
find her exact location, however.[A]
[Right]
Then we'll have to move quickly[N]
and rescue her as soon as possible.[AN]
Otherwise, the rest of Cidor's troops[N]
might catch up and corner us down here.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Mm[Beat] I hate to say this, but if push[N]
comes to shove, we may need to leave[N]
behind some of our allies, as well.[A]
[Right]
Are you serious? These are people that[N]
we've fought together with. They trust us.[N]
You're saying we mght have to leave them?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
It would be difficult, but if we have[N]
no other choice, then [Red]at least the two[N]
of us have to live to see another day.[Red][AN]
Rescuing Dragana is our top priority,[N]
and we can't afford to fail, Loewe.[A]
[Right]
It won't come to that.[Red] I'll make sure[N]
everyone else escapes before us.[Red][N]
That way, no one will be captured.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I hope it does go that easily. Still,[N]
we have to be prepared for anything.[A]

Uh, hello there. Sorry to butt in, but[N]
are you two members of the Liberators?[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
That we are. And who are you?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'm Svetomir, a priest of Vetheim, a[N]
town at the foot of the duke's manse.[N]
I organized a protest against Cidor,[AN]
but he threw me and my fellows in[N]
prison the moment he found out.[N]
You have my thanks for freeing me.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Well, you're safe now. You should[N]
leave while you still can, priest.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Wait! I'm quite the healer, you know.[N]
If you let me join you and give me[N]
a staff, I can mend your wounds.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
You mean to become one of us?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
I've spent my days hoping Byelen would[N]
hear my prayers[Beat] That He would strike[N]
down the invaders and save our country.[AN]
However, I now understand His answer.[AN]
I must take matters into my own hands.[N]
If it'll help you chase out the Cytheans,[AN]
then I'll do anything you need![A]
[MidLeft]
Well[Beat] it's your life. If you wish to[N]
spend it for our cause, then I've no[N]
objections. What about you, Loewe?[A]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
Fine by me. Svetomir seems useful,[N]
and he already has the spirit.[N]
Just don't fall behind, got it?[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
I wouldn't dream of it![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Then I'll give you this staff.[N]
Put it to good use, Svetomir.[A]

Of course. You can count on me![A][X]

Why did I think that was a good idea?[AN]
Anyway, I'd better leave before the[N]

To that, I say phooey! A dog of the[N]
Cythean Empire deserves only scorn.[AN]
Oh, you agree? Well, I'll be stayin'[N]

Oh, I've got plenty to say.[AN]
First, here's a question;[N]
why not end me right here[N]
if you're that afraid of me?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Your death must be public, of course.[N]
The Liberators' spirits won't break[N]
if they don't see it themselves.[AN]

And you felt like you had to tell me[N]
this personally? Surely, you're not[N]

stories about an old flame. Mira's[N]

of them, then I'll just ask this.[AN]
Why bother capturing any of the[N]
others, if you only need me alive?[N]
I didn't think you were so merciful.[AN]
[MidLeft]
In exchange for his services,[N]
Boro requested that I spare anyone[N]
who chose surrender over death.[AN]
That, on top of a large bag of gold[Beat][N]
Regardless, even rebels are countrymen,[N]
so I had no difficulty agreeing with him.[AN]
