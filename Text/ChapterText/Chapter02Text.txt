## Chapter2Title
Ch2: On Tattered Feet[X]

## Chapter2Tutorial
Varga and Cleo, due to their past[N]
connection, join with a Support.[AN]
Support points rise when units[N]
are deployed together, like PoR,[AN]
and there are no limits on supports[N]
except that units can only have one A.[AN]
When a unit targets an enemy, allies[N]
within 3 spaces can give support bonuses.[AN]
Some units provide different bonuses[N]
to each other, depending on pair.[AN]
The amount can be seen by pressing R[N]
on the Support for the pair of units,[N]
shown on the 3rd stat screen page.[A][X]

By Byelen! How large can these[N]
dungeons be? This is the manor[N]
of a nobleman, not a prison, right?[A]
[MidRight]
Actually, I believe this manor is[N]
a converted keep, from before[N]
the Reclamation Wars.[AN]
Decia was forged out of one of the[N]
collapsed kingdoms from those times.[AN]
The architecture and stonework of[N]
this area indicate as such as well.[A]

It was like you two had[N]
practiced that move before.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
We did.[A]
[FarLeft]
What? How-[A]

The general's cell is ahead. And you[N]

I can't wait till I see him. Oh,[AN]
do you have any spare staves or light[N]
tomes? I might as well use 'em, because[N]
I ain't going back to that prison cell.[A]

[MidRight][LoadEmil]
Oh, uh, hey there, Cleo![N]
I just had a question for you.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Very well. Emil, was it? Ask[N]
away, but please make it quick.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Right! So, is it true that[N]
you're from the Cythean Empire?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
That I am[Beat] Why do you ask?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Oh, 'cause I am too![N]
Not often you see another[N]
deserter with the Liberators.[A]
[MidLeft]
Indeed, I never expected that[N]
I would meet a countryman here.[N]
Where do you hail from, Emil?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Just a small village close to the[N]
border of Decia. What about you?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I was born in Gechrysos.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
The capital? Wow, you[N]
must've been rich.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I cannot deny it. My family used our[N]
wealth to give me a stellar education[N]
at a military academy in the city.[AN]
They meant to raise me as the perfect,[N]
honorable officer of the Cythean Empire,[N]
just as my elder brother was before me.[AN]
Of course, that didn't turn out well.[A]
[MidRight]
Guess so, since you're pointing that[N]
axe at 'em. I'd bet that family of[N]
yours doesn't take kindly to that.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Correct. We have long served the imperial[N]
line, and they expected the same of me.[N]
Luckily, they think that I'm dead.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hmm[Beat] Y'know, you really remind[N]
me of the guy who got me in this mess.[N]
Maybe you've heard of him?[A] His name[N]
is Elias Argymos, and he's some general,[N]
I guess. Really talks like one, too.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Some general? You're talking[N]
about the leader of the occupation[N]
in Decia! How did you meet him?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
One day, he came into town recruiting.[N]
Tell you what, he was just like one[N]
of them knights in fairy tales.[AN]
With a man like that in charge,[N]
it seemed like the right thing to do,[N]
fightin' for country and kin and all.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]And then you came here and saw the[N]
truth for your own eyes, as I did.[N]
There was never any justice in this.[A]
[MidRight]
Yeah[Beat] Sure threw me for a loop.[AN]
I was in training for a few weeks,[N]
but then my captain told us to go[N]
raze a town that wouldn't pay tithes.[AN]
I fled the night before, with those[N]
goons chasing me, but the recon unit[N]
ambushed 'em and saved my behind.[AN]
Signed up with the Liberators real[N]
quick after that. I was real surprised[N]
when I found out a key officer was[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
A Cythean? I see why you would be.[N]
I held a commissioned position in[N]
the Cythes army because of my name,[AN]
so when I met General Dragana and[N]
surrendered, I expected a quick death.[N]
Better that than face my own guilt[Beat][AN]
Instead, she let me live. I mean to[N]
repay that mercy in any way that I can.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
That's all we can do now[Beat] Sorry, that[N]
ended up taking longer than I thought.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Yes, we should focus on the mission.[N]
However, it was helpful, discussing[N]
this with someone else who understands.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Agreed. Well, I'll go on ahead, Cleo.[N]
Maybe we can talk some other time![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Argymos[Beat] So Emil met my brother?[N]
If I continue on this path,[N]
I may have to see him soon[Beat][A][X]
