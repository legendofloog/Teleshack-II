Ch3: Make or Break[X]

[MidLeft][LoadDragana]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidLeft]
Hah[Beat] Hah[Beat][A]
[Right]
General, are you alright?[N]
Do you need a healer?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Ah[Beat] No, I've dealt with much worse.[N]
I'm just not as fit as I'd like to be,[N]
after being stuck in a cell that long.[AN]
[FarRight]
Let's take a short break, then.[N]
Boro's holding them off well enough,[N]
and we need to figure out where to go.[A]
[Right]
Speaking of[Beat] What happened out there,[N]
general? You placed Loewe and I far away[N]
from where Duke Cidor's ambush occurred.[AN]
How did everything go poorly so quickly?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well[Beat] It started with Boro's[N]
disappearance during the mission.[AN]
In the attack on the soldier outpost[N]
in Vetheim, that town by Cidor's manse,[N]
Boro's force had the most important job.[AN]
That is, they were the vanguard for us.[N]
So, of course, when he went missing,[N]
everything fell into disarray quickly.[AN]
What was meant to be a precise strike[N]
turned into a disorganized raid,[N]
and this alerted Cidor to our presence.[AN]
I sent out an order for retreat soon[N]
after, but it was already too late.[N]
And so, here we all are now.[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox][LoadCleoAngry]
That snake[Beat] Does Boro have any idea[N]
what his hunger for gold has cost us?[AN]
Vetheim's outpost is the most important[N]
link in the Cythes's supply chain.[AN]
Had we taken it down, that would have[N]
greatly helped the liberation effort.[AN]
What kind of dastard would back out[N]
just when we needed him the most?[AN]
Maybe he planned this from the sta-[A]
[FarRight]
That's enough, Cleo. Even if Boro's[N]
looking out for himself, he wasn't[Beat][AN]
He used to really believe in the cause.[N]
And he just saved us, didn't he?[AN]
I don't know what happened to him,[N]
but[Beat] Dragana, what do you think?[AN]
What caused him to change so much?[A]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Who knows?[OpenEyes] I couldn't tell you.[AN]
Everyone's got a breaking point,[N]
and I guess he finally found his.[AN]
Regardless, I can only blame myself[N]
for failing to recover from his loss[N]
and leave things at that for now.[AN]
We've got more important things[N]
to worry over, like escaping.[AN]
This place is one hell of a maze[Beat][N]
Do you two know the way out?[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Can't help you there. Selesian soldiers[N]
knocked me out before taking me away.[AN]
[Right]
And all I know is what Loewe managed[N]
to send right before they did that.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hmm[Beat] Well, that's not good.[AN]
I remember bits and pieces[N]
from when they took me here,[N]
but it's all a bit hazy.[AN]
It'd be better if someone else[N]
could help us out here[Beat][A][X]


## Ch3BeginningScene1_MiraHere
[FarLeft][LoadMira]
[Left][LoadDragana]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadLoewe]
[FarLeft]
If we go south, then east,[N]
that'll take us outside.[AN]
I remember these halls well[N]
from my time as a spy here.[AN]
[Left]
Reliable as always, Mira.[N]
Then we'll follow your lead.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Mm. Don't fall behind.[A][CSSCF]
[Right]
That's right, Mira used to work for[N]
Duke Cidor. Quite convenient, hm?[AN]
[Left]
Yes, her knowledge has served me well[N]
time and time again, as you'd expect.[AN]
I'm sure that she's been useful to you[N]
two as well, navigating this maze.[AN]
[FarRight]
For that, and a lot more, Dragana.[N]
Was she really just a spymaster?[AN]
Her combat prowess makes it hard[N]
for me to believe, that's all.[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]Didn't I teach you not to pry,[N]
Loewe?[A] If you really want to know,[N]
though, then ask the woman herself.[AN]
You know, when we're not running[N]
for our lives. Understand?[AN]
[FarRight]
Y-Yes, Dragana. Sorry,[N]
I'll go on ahead.[A][CSSCF]
[Left]
Ugh, that boy[Beat] Cleo, let's go.[AN]
If we let Loewe out of our sight,[N]
he might get himself jailed again.[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
Well, we can't let that happen, can we?[N]
I'll watch your back, general![A][X]

## Ch3BeginningScene1_VargaHere
[FarLeft][LoadVarga]
[Left][LoadDragana]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadLoewe]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]If you take the path south,[N]
we can leave through the east.[AN]
[Left]
You're Varga, right? Thanks.[N]
How many enemies are waiting for us?[AN]
[Left]
As many as anywhere else.[N]
Nothing that we can't handle.[AN]
[FarRight]
No offense, but can we really trust him?[N]
He turned on his old allies real quick.[AN]
[Right]
He's[Beat] an old acquaintance of mine.[N]
If you need an explanation, then-[AN]
[FarRight]
No, that's fine. We don't have time,[AN]
and honestly, it's not like we have[N]
any better plan than following him.[AN]
[Left]
It'd be different if Mira were around.[AN]
She knew so much about Selese,[N]
and Duke Cidor's manse especially.[AN]
[Beat]I thought she, of all people,[N]
would've made it back to me.[A]
[Right]
I'm sorry, Dragana. She entrusted me[N]
with command, and I let her down.[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]Maybe so, but you made it this far,[N]
which is as much as we could hope for.[AN]
Let's just make sure that her faith[N]
wasn't misplaced[Beat] In you, and in me.[A]
[FarLeft]
A wise choice. Now, follow me.[A][X]

## Ch3BeginningScene1_NoOneHere
[MidLeft][LoadDragana]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight]
[Beat]Looks like nobody else knows.[AN]
It's not ideal, but we'll have[N]
to rely on Dragana's memory.[AN]
Even though she's a bit[Beat][N]
challenged, directionally.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What? That is not[Beat] Alright, it's a[N]
little bit true, but I'm all we've got.[AN]
It'd be different if Mira were around.[AN]
She knew so much about Selese,[N]
and Duke Cidor's manse especially.[AN]
[Beat]I thought she, of all people,[N]
would've made it back to me.[A]
[Right]
I'm sorry, Dragana. She entrusted me[N]
with command, and I let her down.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Maybe so, but you made it this far,[N]
which is as much as we could hope for.[AN]
Let's just make sure that her faith[N]
wasn't misplaced[Beat] In you, and in me.[A]
[Right][LoadCleoSad]
How can I believe in myself[N]
when I've lost Varga as well?[AN]
He came here to save me,[N]
and I led him to his death.[AN]
[FarRight]
I don't know what he was to you,[N]
but we have to keep moving, Cleo.[AN]
I'm sure that's what he would want, too.[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]Easier said than done, Loewe.[N]
But you're right, we can't stay here.[AN]
General, which way to the exit?[A]
[MidLeft]
Hm[Beat] I'm pretty sure we go south here.[N]
From there, let's play it by ear.[AN]
With any luck, we'll escape quickly,[N]
and if not[Beat] Let's not think about it.[A][CSSCF]
[FarRight]
[Beat]Byelen help us.[A][CSSCF]
[Right][CloseEyes]
Varga[Beat] I won't die here.[N][OpenEyes][LoadCleo]
I'll make it home, one day.[A][X]

// Dragana, Cleo, and Loewe find the exit, which is heavily guarded
//  

## Ch3BeginningScene2 
[MidLeft][LoadDragana]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
This looks like the place[Beat][N]
Just like we thought, there're[N]
plenty of soldiers on guard here.[AN]
Loewe, Cleo, are you ready for a fight?[A]
[Right]
Of course. They didn't see us coming,[N]
so we can use the element of surprise[N]
to secure a path to the exit outside.[AN]
As long as us three escape this place,[N]
then this'll be a successful mission.[AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Sure, but let's make sure the rest[N]
of the Liberators make it out, too.[AN]
We'll need everyone's strength[N]
to strike back against Cidor later.[N]
Don't you agree, Dragana?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha[Beat] You two have really grown[N]
in my absence, haven't you?[N]
But it's just as you say.[AN]
We've come this far, so I'll rely[N]
on the both of you a bit longer[N]
until I'm fully recovered.[AN]
For the sake of all our hopes[Beat][N]
Let's carve through Cidor's men[N]
and live til tomorrow! For Decia![A][X]

## Ch3BeginningSceneEmoryIntro
[MidLeft][LoadSeleseF]
[MidRight][LoadEmory]
The Liberators[Beat] Men, to arms![AN]
If their leader's escaped her cell,[N]
then I'll carry out the execution.[AN]
Let's quash these rebel scum[N]
where our compatriots couldn't![AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Yes, captain![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
And if we cannot, our lord has never[N]
been one to sit idly by and watch.[AN]
So long as we prevent their escape,[AN]
trust that Duke Cidor will arrive[N]
and crush their hopes in our place![A][X]

## ReinforcementText
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
They must have gotten through[N]
Boro. What do we do now?[AN]
We can't just leave him[N]
after he did that for us[Beat][A]
[MidRight]
We don't have the time, Loewe.[N]
It's too late to turn around now.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
But he-[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[MidRight][MoveFarRight][MidLeft][ClearFace][Right][LoadLoewe][MidLeft][LoadDragana]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Cleo's right. We have to push forward[N]
before Cidor's troops catch up to us.[AN]
Besides, Boro's not selfless enough to[N]
sacrifice himself. I'm sure he escaped,[AN]
so let's just make sure that he didn't[N]
waste his efforts getting us here.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Of course, Dragana.[A][X]

Wh- Alex, Axel? What on earth[N]
are you two doing in here?[A]

[Right][OneLineBox]
Boss, we can explain![A]

[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
We came in to help you[N]
guys out but, well-[A]

[Right]
We might've gotten[N]
found out, oops.[A]

[MidLeft]
Idiots! You were supposed to[N]
stay with the rest of the squad![A]

[FarRight]
Yeah, but they're fine[N]
on their own outside![A]

[Right][MoveRight]
And you guys probably[N]
needed the help more![A]

[MidLeft]
Thats not the point! What if[N]
we hadn't come this way?[AN]
You'd be rotting in Cidor's jails[N]
for the rest of your days.[AN]

[Right][ToggleSmile]
Yeah, but we aren't, and[N]
thats what matters![A]

[FarRight][OneLineBox]
And now we can help you![A]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Sometimes I wonder how[N]
I ever let you two onto[N]
the recon squad[Beat][CloseEyes][A]

[FarRight][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
I mean, you need someone who can[N]
handle themselves in a brawl.[A]

[Right]
And we're two for[N]
the price of one![A]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox][OpenEyes]
Ha[Beat] Whatever, you knuckleheads.[N]
Come on, do what you[N]
do best. Let's move![A]

## DraganaCleoTalkCh3Text
[MidLeft][LoadDragana][MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Cleo, I wish to speak with you.[A]

[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Yes, general?[A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I wanted you to know[Beat][AN]
I am so impressed with what[N]
you've done here today.[A]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Thank you, general, but I have[N]
so much more to learn from you.[AN]
The academy never gave me the same[N]
real world experience that you've[N]
taught me, so I'm still lacking.[A]

[MidLeft]
And there will be time for that,[N]
but you're my adjutant for a[N]
reason. I trust in your skills.[A]

[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Of course, general[Beat][A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
What's wrong, Cleo? I can tell[N]
something is eating at you.[A]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Well I[Beat] I don't know how[N]
you stay strong at times like[N]
this. Doing this, it's terrifying.[AN]
Any of us could've died on this[N]
mission. What if we had lost you?[N]
What would happen to the Liberators?[A]

[MidLeft]
[CloseEyes][Beat][OpenEyes]
Cleo, the truth is I'm always scared.[N]
Everyone is. I put on a brave face[N]
because people need someone to.[AN]
They need it so they can feel[N]
brave themselves. But even as a[N]
leader, the fear still affects us all.[A]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Ah. I see[Beat] Thank you,[N]
general. It means a lot.[A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Of course, Cleo. Anytime.[N]
Now,[ToggleSmile] lead the way![A]

## DraganaLoeweTalkCh3Text
[MidLeft][LoadDragana][MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Loewe, I hear this rescue[N]
attempt was of your doing.[A]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
If you can call it that. I only[N]
wound up getting myself caught.[N]
Cleo's the one who made it work[Beat][A]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That's not true, Loewe. It's your[N]
decisiveness that brought everyone[N]
here to begin with at all, right?[A]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[CloseEyes]
[Beat]But I still got captured. I just[N]
wound up making it harder to rescue you.[A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
And I also got captured, Loewe.[N]
Am I a bad leader?[A]

[MidRight][OneLineBox][OpenEyes]

Well[Beat] No, you're not[Beat][A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Then neither are you.[N]
You did what you thought was right.[AN]
Even if you made mistakes, what matters[N]
is you tried. Your mother would be proud.[A]

[MidRight][OneLineBox]

me and my bro down, huh?[AN]
Get ready for a beatdown![AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadEmory]
Hmph[Beat] I am no [OpenQuote]guy", knave.[AN]
I am one of Duke Cidor's[N]
finest knights, Emory![AN]
Let me show you why[N]
my lord trusts in me![A][CSSCF]

Fine by me, give it a shot.[N]

Oh, you want a tussle?[N]
Fine by me. Let's go![A][X]

## EmoryDraganaBattleQuote
[MidLeft][LoadEmory]
You must be the leader of[N]
this band of miscreants.[AN]
As Duke Cidor's knight,[N]
I'll be your executioner![AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadDragana]
A knight[Beat] Is that what you[N]
think you are?[A] If all you do[N]
is mindlessly follow Cidor,[AN]
you're no more than a dog.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadEmory]
[Beat]A nice sentiment,[N]
but it rings hollow from you.[AN]
What would you know,[N]
rebel, about knighthood?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadDragana]
I used to serve House Freyse,[N]
before Decia's collapse.[AN]
Everything I did was in their[N]
name until Cythes took over,[AN]
but from then on, I witnessed[N]
the depravity of our invaders.[AN]
I witnessed the destruction,[N]
the despair that they spread.[AN]
[Beat]If you witnessed the same[N]
and still believe in Cidor,[AN]
in his vision for Decia as[N]
nothing but a Cythean puppet,[AN]
then your service is to a man,[N]
not to the people he serves.[AN]
And that? That is no knight.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadEmory]
I[Beat] You're mistaken![AN]
For Selese's security,[N]
we had no choice but to-[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadDragana]
There's always a choice,[N]
and you made the wrong one.[AN]
Now, allow me to show you[N]
the pride of a true knight![A][X]

## EmoryEmilBattleQuote

Another who's come to meet[N]
my blade[Beat] Hm, wait a moment.[AN]
Emil, what are you doing here?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadEmil]
[Beat]Same as you, I'd guess.[N]
Fightin' for what's right.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadEmory]
Then you're on the wrong side.[AN]
I would have preferred you stay[N]
out of this, for Lise's sake,[AN]
but you still have a choice.[N]
Come over to this side, Emil.[AN]
I don't want to kill[N]
my wife's only brother.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadEmil]
Sorry, but I can't do that.[AN]
I've seen what Cythes does[N]
to the people in Decia,[AN]
and no matter what you say,[N]
I won't close my eyes to it.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadEmory]
[Beat]I see that you won't be[N]
swayed, not by my words.[AN]
Then there's nothing more[N]
to say. Raise your spear![AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadEmil]
Sis, I'm sorry for this[Beat][N]
But this is how it has to be.[AN]
Alright, Emory! Just try it![A][X]

## EmoryBattleQuote
[MidLeft][LoadEmory]
Blasted Liberators,[N]
you think your cause is just?[AN]
I will demonstrate your folly[N]
with the weight of my blade![A][X]

## EmoryCaptureQuote

I[Beat] You won't kill me,[N]
even after I raised my blade?[AN]
Hm[Beat] Do as you wish, then.[AN]

so I'll return to my wife.[N]

Besides, she's not YOUR daughter,[N]

Of course it was worth it, Mira.[N]
But we've talked enough, haven't we?[AN]
I'm putting an end to this[N]

General Dragana. That you and your rats[N]

But it seems I overestimated you.[N]
With these forces at my back,[N]
you have nowhere else to run.[AN]
Abandon all hope, and I may show mercy.[N]
But whether you choose jail or death,[N]
your foolish dreams are naught but ashes.[AN]
Today marks the end of the Liberators![A][X]
