Ch4: Daybreak[X]

## Ch4_WM_Text
[OpenQuote]General Dragana is dead."[AN]
This truth echoes through the hearts[N]
of the Liberators as they flee Selese.[AN]
In her absence, the survivors now follow[N]
their general's adjutants: Loewe and Cleo.[AN][Event]
Loewe can do little but trudge forward,[N]
deeply shaken by the loss of Dragana.[AN][Event]
Cleo, however, keeps her focus on the[N]
survival of the remnants they command.[AN][Event]
The two agree that they need to acquire[N]
a ship and return to their island base,[AN]
so that they can regroup with their[N]
comrades that remained behind there.[AN][Event]
They only have one route to the coast[N]
and its ports: Tauris Valley.[AN][Event]
Driven by desperation, they march[N]
and pray Cidor's pursuit yields...[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][LoadCleo][OneLineBox]
Loewe, a word?[A]
[MidLeft]
Hm? What is it, Cleo?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
It's about our future strategy.[AN]
Now that[Beat] Dragana is gone,[N]
deciding who to deploy and where[N]
is our responsibility alone.[AN]
We have few choices right now,[N]
but once we reach our base,[N]
there are decisions we must make.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Sure, but what about it?[AN]
I was just planning on[N]
fielding our strongest[N]
fighters whenever we can.[AN]
[MidRight]
It isn't that simple, Loewe.[AN]
The two of us have a responsibility[N]
to lead the main unit at all times,[N]
but not everyone can handle that.[AN]
The rush from the jailbreak[N]
is already wearing off, so our[N]
comrades will [Red]fatigue[Red] soon.[AN]
When that happens, they'll be unable[N]
to consider anything but surviving,[N]
[Red]learning nothing from field experience.[Red][AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]True. If they're run into the ground[N]
like that, then we may not even be able[N]
to [Red]use them for the next mission.[Red][AN]
[MidRight]
Exactly. For that reason, we should[N]
keep a careful eye on our group and[N]
rotate out anyone nearing exhaustion.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You're not wrong, but there are times[N]
when it's better to leave someone in[N]
if the mission really needs them.[AN]
[Beat]I'll let you make the call, Cleo.[N]
You'll make a better choice than me,[N]
especially right now.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Very well, then.[N]
Leave it to me![A][X]

## FatigueExplanation
When allied units perform actions,[N]
their Fatigue increases accordingly,[N]
except Cleo and Loewe who are exempt.[AN]
If a unit's Fatigue becomes greater[N]
than their maximum HP, they cannot[N]
be deployed during the next chapter.[AN]
Further, any action that would give[N]
them EXP or WEXP will give nothing[N]
until they rest and reset their Ftg.[AN]
The Fatigued status is noted by a[N]
sweat icon on the unit's map sprite.[A][X]

Mmgh[Beat] The scar has set in, I see.[AN]
One arrow, no matter how true,[N]
shouldn't have been enough[N]
to leave me bedridden like this[Beat][AN]
I should be leading the hunt[N]
for Dragana's misguided zealots,[N]
not relying on others to do the job.[AN]
[Beat]Speaking of, where is that boy?[N]
I told him to be here, and yet, he's-[A]
[FarFarRight][LoadTiberius][TwoLineBox]
Uncle, may I come in?[A]
[MidLeft]
Tiberius?[N]
You're late.[AN]
[FarFarRight][MoveMidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I apologize for that, truly,[N]
but I have good news for you.[AN]
Scouts in the Tauris Valley[N]
have sighted your quarry,[N]
fleeing south towards the coast.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Good news[Beat] Hmph, I wonder.[N]
Regardless, thank you for the report.[AN]
However[Beat] a piece of advice, nephew.[AN]
If you're to take my place as duke,[N]
grow accustomed to being punctual.[N]
Others may not be as lenient as I.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
O-Of course. But I[Beat][N]
Am I truly the right choice?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Do you see anyone else who will do?[AN]
With my daughter beyond my reach,[N]
you alone can take her place.[N]
[Beat]Listen to me, Tiberius.[AN]
In the place of my brother,[N]
I've watched over you since[N]
you took your first steps.[AN]
I know, more than anyone,[N]
the kind of man you can be[N]
if you follow my example.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Your words are kind, but[Beat][N]
No, you're right, Uncle Cidor.[AN]
If you believe in my potential,[N]
then I'll trust in that belief.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Good. There'll be much to learn[N]
in the coming months, I suspect[Beat][AN]
But for now, allow me to rest.[N]
I'll require all of my strength[N]
if the Liberators evade us again.[AN]
[MidRight]
Understood, but please, listen to[N]
your healers! I can handle any duties[N]
around the manse until you recover.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Thank you, Tiberius.[N]
I'm counting on you.[A][CSS]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
The boy doesn't understand the weight[N]
that we, as House Selese, must bear.[AN]
Well, there'll be time to impress[N]
the realities of lordship upon him,[N]
so long as I recover quickly.[AN]
[Beat]As for the Liberators, Tauris Valley?[AN]
Just as expected. Sir Hilmar should[N]
be able to handle them well enough,[AN]
but if not, I still have Selesian[N]
soldiers stationed in nearby ports.[AN]
Whatever hope they think they have[Beat][N]
It'll disappear with the night.[N]
For Decia's sake, it must[Beat][A][X]

Huh? Oh, sorry. I didn't see them,[N]
but Selese has plenty of those.[AN]
Wouldn't doubt it if they were[N]
looking for us on Cidor's orders.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Well, we'd better hope that they[N]
have nothing to report back to him.[AN]
There's still a long way to go until[N]
we arrive at Elmhurst Island,[AN]
and before that, we need to meet[N]
back up with Zwieback and Filone.[AN]
They should be waiting around here[Beat][N]
Loewe, do you see them anywhere?[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadCleoAngry]
Loewe, come on! You can't even focus[N]

I just saw this arrow on the ground[Beat][N]
But it's way too big for any ol' bow.[AN]

Neither of our mounts look any worse[N]

Apologies for our late arrival,[N]
but things didn't go as planned.[AN]
[Left]
It's fine. Just glad you two got back[N]
safe and sound, what with everything.[AN]
I'd have gone with you, but well,[AN]
someone's gotta watch out for Filone,[N]
even if all she's guardin' are mounts.[AN]
[FarLeft]
H-Hey, I can fight, Dad![N]
If I have to, anyway[Beat][AN]
[Right]
[Beat]Seriously, thanks, to both of you.[N]
We needed a bit of good news, right now.[AN]
[FarLeft]
H-Huh? What's that mean, Loewe?[AN]
[Left]
Dragana didn't make it, did she?[AN]
She'd be right at the front with ya,[N]
if she did. I know she would be.[AN]
[Right][LoadLoeweSad][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Yeah, you're right. We got to her[N]
cell and broke her out of there.[AN]
Just a few more steps, and she[N]
would've been here with us[Beat][N]
But I failed her. I let her down![AN]
[FarLeft]
I'm sure she wouldn't see it that way![AN]
At least you freed some of the others,[N]
right? It's not all bad, you know?[N]
[Beat]I'm not good at this, am I?[AN]
[Left]
Good try, but what Loewe needs to hear[N]
is the truth. Listen up, kid.[AN]
Dragana could've saved her own hide[N]
if she threw some of you in Cidor's way,[N]
right? The duke'd do the same, I reckon.[AN]
But Dragana trusted you both[N]
enough to lay down her life,[N]
believin' that you'd take up her torch.[AN]
And the looks on the faces of everyone[N]
else[Beat] I'd say they feel the same.[N]
It's time you make good on those hopes.[AN]
[FarRight]
He's right, Loewe. It's our duty, now.[N]
You don't need to bear it alone,[N]
either. I'm right here with you.[AN]

Where's the rest of your crew?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, I guess you're not dim enough[N]
to think that I came alone.[AN]
Sneaking past you lot during[N]
the night was simple enough.[AN]
We've been waiting for you to meet[N]
your friends[Beat] All so that I can[N]
eliminate you rats in one fell swoop![AN]
You hear that, everyone? Come on out![AN]
Whoever kills their leaders[N]

Get it done by daybreak's end,[N]

By those things, you mean[Beat][AN]

Do you see all the ballistae?[A]

After Dragana's death, no one would[N]

mean well, but I've been here longer.[AN]
Do you seriously think I'd back down,[N]

No, that's not it. I[Beat][N]
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lashed[N]
out like that, before the fight.[AN][LoadLoeweSad]
I'm just[Beat] tired, of everything.[N]
With Dragana around, no matter how[N]
tough things got, I knew we'd win.[AN]
But with her weight on my shoulders,[N]
I[Beat] don't know what to do, anymore.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's a natural feeling, Loewe.[AN]
But with Dragana passing on and Boro[N]
leaving us, we have precious few[N]
people who can take her place.[AN]
Trajan's busy guarding our base,[N]
and no one else has the same[N]
leadership qualities[Beat] save us.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah. It's so much pressure[Beat][N]
All these years, I just had to fight.[N]
Dragana taught me everything I know.[AN]

[Beat]You called her your mother, yes?[AN]
I never knew mine, so I can't relate[N]
to the pain that you feel. Even so,[N]
anyone could see how much she loved you.[AN]
And because of that, I know that she[N]
believed in you until her last breath.[AN]
She believed that we could take her[N]
place, if the worst ever came to pass.[N]

[MidRight][LoadLoewe][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Ha! When you put it that way,[N]

Anyway, you know this area better[N]
than I do. What's our next move?[AN]

[Beat]Port Neufchatel isn't too far[N]
from here, from what I remember.[AN]
My mom, er, my real mom, used to go[N]
there to get letters from back home.[AN]
If we travel west down the road,[N]
we'll get there in no time flat.[AN]
[Beat]Go on ahead with the others, Cleo.[N]
I'll be right behind you guys, alright?[AN]

I'll have to apologize to you.[AN]
From here on out, I won't let[N]
