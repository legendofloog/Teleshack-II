## Ch5_WM_Text
With defeat of their pursuers,[AN]
the Liberators gain an essential,[N]
but momentary, reprieve from danger.[AN][Event]
Their march to Port Neufchatel[N]
is uneventful, to their relief.[AN]
When they arrive, Cleo and Loewe[N]
agree to search separately for a boat,[AN]
in hopes that some brave, or greedy,[N]
soul will agree to accomodate rebels...[A][X]

[OpenRight][LoadLoewe]
Any luck, Cleo? People are[N]
giving us suspicious looks.[AN]
[Left]
None. No one is willing to[N]
transport a group of our size.[AN]
At least, not for a price[N]
we can afford to pay.[AN]
We may need to change plans[N]
and try again at another port.[AN]
[OpenRight]
Another port? The others are dead[N]
on their feet as it is, Cleo.[AN]
Do you think they can make it[N]
that far,[A] let alone fight off[N]
any Selesians we run into?[AN]
[Left]
Well, do you have any better ideas?[N]
If not, then my plan is the best we've-[A]
[OpenFarFarRight][TwoLineBox]

a boat ride?[AN][X]

[FarLeft]
Hm? It's you[Beat][AN]
I asked you about a boat no[N]
more than ten minutes ago.[AN]
Why the change of heart?[N]
We can't pay what you want.[AN]
[FarRight]
As it turns out, I have another[N]
passenger who can handle your share.[AN]
He overheard you loudmouths and[N]
took pity on you, or so I'd guess.[AN]
Can't see why else a traveler would[N]
be willing to pony up that gold![AN]
But as long as I've got the coin,[N]
you've got yourself a boat ride.[AN]
I ain't going to wait around forever,[N]
so make a decision quick, alright?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Not sure what other choice[N]
we have. Right, Cleo?[AN]
[Left]
Hm[Beat] given the alternatives,[N]
I don't see why not. Thank you, Miss.[AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
You got some nice manners,[N]
girl. Call me Longxia. Well,[N]
with that settled, follow me.[A][X]

## BoatTalk1
[Left][LoadCleo][OpenRight][LoadLoewe]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Loewe[Beat] how are you feeling?[AN]
[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]
Cleo? I'm alright, honest.[AN]
Just thinking about what comes next,[N]
when we reach Elmhurst Island.[AN]
[Left]
We're partners in leadership now, no?[N]
We can think about that together.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Let's just hope that two heads[N]
are actually better than one.[AN]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadKwame]
Two heads are better than one,[N]
but have you considered three?[AN][X]

## BoatTalk2
[FarLeft][LoadLoewe][Left][LoadCleo]
[OpenRight][LoadKwame][FarRight][LoadLongxia]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
So, you're our mysterious patron.[N]
I'm Cleo, and this is Loewe.[N]
Your generosity is appreciated.[AN]
[OpenRight]
You owe me no thanks, Lady Cleo, for[N]
it may be good fortune that we've met.[N]
I can tell you've suffered a deep loss.[AN]
Perhaps a friend or a mentor.[N]
Perhaps one who was both.[N]
Am I wrong?[AN]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox][Beat] Yes, we have.[N]
But what do you have to[N]
do with any of this?[AN]
[OpenRight]
I've deduced that you are fleeing.[N]
The Cytheans continue to take Decia[N]
town by town, castle by castle.[AN]
Word of captured liberators escaping[N]
has galvanized those who dare resist,[N]
but Decians remain weak and disorganized.[AN]
The Cytheans' reach grows ever farther.[N]
From what I've heard, they continue to[N]
march to the deserts of Mahemen as well.[AN]
With every stroke of midnight,[N]
the Cytheans claim more and more of[N]
of Orodreth as their own once more.[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Word on the seas is that they're fixing[N]
to take the fight further south.[AN]
[Left]So conquering Decia and Mahemen to[N]
establish footholds east and west[Beat][AN]
Is their plan to attack the[N]
southernmost kingdom of Chouwouj?[AN]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Chouwouj? Sure, they have resources,[N]
but they're not much of a kingdom.[AN]
Their bluebloods all died out[N]
years before I was even born.[AN]
All that's left are bands of[N]
power-hungry warlords, carving[N]
up territories for themselves.[AN]
What could the Cytheans want there?[AN]
[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I have my suspicions, but[N]
it is not my place to say.[AN]
Regardless, I have decided to stake[N]
my lot with you all henceforth.[AN]
That's why I paid for[N]
your safe passage.[AN]
[FarRight]
[ToggleMouthMove](Paid upfront too! What a sap!)[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[Left]
So, you knew we were the[N]
Liberators all along[Beat][AN]
[OpenRight][ThreeLineBox]
Well, of course I did.[N]
You certainly don't take[N]
great lengths to hide this.[AN]
[FarLeft][LoadLoeweAngry][OneLineBox]
You dare mock us!?[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Loewe, please.[N]
This isn't the time.[AN]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Look, it all seems a bit suspect[N]
that this mysterious old man[N]
seems to know the Cytheans' plans,[AN]
and was willing to pay our fare.[N]
Something smells fishy,[N]
and it isn't the sea water.[AN]
[FarRight]
That's just Fangai steaming[N]
some supper for us.[N]
A fresh catch of lobster.[AN]
[Left]
I'm sure that will be lovely, but[N]
this isn't the time to discuss food.[N]
I agree with Loewe's concerns.[AN][FarLeft][LoadLoewe][Left]
Besides, you've yet to share your name.[AN]
[OpenRight]
Ah yes, pardon me.[N]
How rude I've been to you all.[N]
You may call me[Beat] Kwame.[AN]
[Left]
So, Sir Kwame, how can we trust you?[N]
You're not Cythean, that much is clear.[AN]
You've been far too subtle with us[N]
to be on their side in this conflict.[N]
Be straight with us. What do you want?[AN]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
Ho, Lady Cleo, I admire your moxie![N]
Your words strike like a knife through[N]
warm butter. Clean and precise.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Then let me speak plain. I believe that[N]
I will be of good service to you all,[N]
as well. I wish to join your band.[AN]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
You can fight?[AN]
[OpenRight][ThreeLineBox]
In a pinch, but I much prefer the arts[N]
of strategy, tactics, and diplomacy.[N]
I'm sure I can serve you well.[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Very well. You may[N]
travel with us, Sir Kwame.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Really, Cleo? That easily?[N]
We don't know what he's after.[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Loewe, we don't have a choice.[N]
He's clearly not with the Cytheans,[N]
which makes him a friend for now.[AN]
[OpenRight]
As sound a reason as any, Lady Cleo.[N]
Sir Loewe, I'm sure that in time,[N]
you will come to trust me.[AN]
There is no doubt that without your[N]
intervention, all peoples of Orodreth[N]
will bend the knee to the Emperor.[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Always doom and gloom[N]
with you soldier types.[AN]
Like most common folk ain't bending[N]
and bowing to anyone holding a spear.[AN]
Come on, if you don't like lobster,[N]
I'll steam some clams for you.[AN]
The fruits of the sea, they call them.[AN]
Steam with a little butter, some white[N]
wine, and an onion[Beat][A] you'll[N]
have nothing to worry about.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Food does sound good[Beat][N]
Thank you, Captain Longxia.[AN]
[FarRight]
Always wiser to think on a full[N]
stomach[Beat] Better eat soon.[AN]
Looks like the fog's rolling in.[AN]

You know, it does feel a tad[N]
warmer all of a sudden[Beat][AN][CloseSpeechSlow][X]

Don't let that lobster spoil.[N]
We'll take care of this.[AN]

I'll tend to our supper below deck[N]
while you get your troops ready.[N]
As long as they don't damage our ship,[AN]
we can make it out of this alive.[N]
If we keep sailing towards the Straits of[N]
Leonazium, they won't be able to pursue.[AN]

Ocean's warming up and[N]
rain's about to fall.[AN]
They'll be blinded by the steam.[N]
That's when we strike.[AN]
Those traitorous dastards aren't[N]
getting out of here alive.[AN]
And if we can't do it[Beat][N]
those geysers will certainly finish 'em.[AN]
Prepare to board them![AN]
More of our allies will emerge from[N]
the stairs. That'll really spook 'em![AN]
And to top things off,[AN]
just wait 'til you see[N]
the pegasi from the south.[AN]
It's a foolproof plan.[N][.4][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]
I can end it all here[Beat][AN]
This will be the moment everyone[N]
remembers Riggan for.[AN]
I'll be the hero of the Cythean[N]
Empire[Beat] Yes, me.[AN]
Mom[Beat] Shafaqat[Beat][N][OpenEyes]
will you be proud?[A][X]

It looks like the Cythean navy is[N]
captained by a powerful mage.[AN]
By warming the ocean and mixing it with[N]
the falling rain, he can create steam[Beat][AN]
It's a clever trick, but nothing more.[AN]
Be careful when moving between boats,[N]
especially on the [Red]planks[Red]. If you aren't,[AN]
the steam geysers will make you regret it.[AN]
Focus on keeping them at bay. They'll[N]
relent if we hold out long enough.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]

I ain't gonna let the dastards[N]

As the captain says, I'm yours.[N]
I am Fangai, a traveling dark mage.[AN]
[OpenRight]
Surprised you still can call yourself[N]
that, considering you mostly just cook.[AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
There's nothing wrong with being[N]
well-versed in a number of interests.[N]
It'd do much to broaden your character.[AN]
If you cared about something else,[N]
you know, beyond this damned boat and coin,[N]
you may be a more interesting companion.[AN]

Should I beg for my life now?[AN]

That won't be necessary, Riggan.[AN]
Unlike your Cythean masters,[N]
we have no desire to harm[N]
anyone who's not a threat.[AN]
Give us your weapons[N]

## LoreCh5Text
[Left][LoadCleo][FarLeft][LoadLoewe][MidRight][LoadKwame]
[FarLeft]
Finally[Beat] we made it.[N]
Thanks for all your help.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Truth be told, your army did most of[N]
the heavy lifting. I can wax poetic[N]
on the art of warfare all day,[AN]
but to fight in one is an[N]
entirely different skill.[A]
[Left]
You never did tell us how you became[N]
so knowledgeable. Typically, only nobles[N]
have access to such an education,[AN]
but any of the military men and women[N]
we've worked with learned through harsh[N]
trials and the mentorship of others.[AN]
You seem to be a different sort entirely.[A]
[MidRight]
Perceptive you are, young liberators.[N]
I knew it would be wise to stake my lot[N]
with you all. As for my education,[AN]
some may say I was fortunate,[N]
and others may say I was unlucky.[N]
It's all a matter of perspective, really.[A]
[FarLeft]
Speak straight with us, Kwame.[N]
I tire of your riddles.[N]
What are your aims?[A]
[MidRight]
The same as yours: To restore peace to[N]
this land. To end the Cytheans' plot[N]
of continental conquest.[AN]
To save the world from ruin, dramatic as[N]
it may sound. But this isn't the Mahemen[N]
opera, for we are on the stage of reality.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
So why are they doing this, then?[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Surely there's more to their[N]
plot than mere conquest.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Indeed. While they shroud their goals[N]
today in fog, perhaps history can be our[N]
guide. May I share a tale with you two?[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
A history lesson?[N]
[Beat]Alright.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Please go on, Sir Kwame.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Very well. Gather around, for a tale[N]
I will tell. Pardon me if you know[N]
stories from the book of old lore,[AN]
for it is how I came upon this[N]
tale, and from where I will recite it.[A]
[Left]
The Book of Havarti? It's the most well[N]
known account of the continent of[N]
Orodreth's origin, at least as we know it.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Havarti[Beat] He was a Mahemen scribe[N]
who served the rulers of old.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Very good. You are both quite well-learned,[N]
it seems. That should make this easier.[N]
Please, I implore you to take a seat.[AN]
We may be here for a while. Now then,[N]
where to begin. There are many beginnings,[N]
in fact, but we must set the right context.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Just get on with it, please.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Do not be hasty, I am merely setting the[N]
mood. I trust the fire's crackle and the[N]
moon will provide the proper ambience[Beat][AN]
[Beat]The Cythean Empire we know today was[N]
once far grander. As humanity progressed,[N]
their great rulers fostered innovations.[AN]
That supported vast population growth,[N]
making many men and women wealthy.[N]
However, after centuries of unity,[AN]
unique cultures began to emerge in the[N]
empire, and the descendents of once wise[N]
rulers turned to malice and greed.[AN]
Generations of rulers oppressed those[N]
from the regions of Decia, Mahemen,[N]
and Chouwouj, among others of Orodreth.[AN]
They whittled away at their independence[N]
and gains from the benevolent rulers of old.[N]
[OpenQuote]Bestowed upon me," Abalone IX declared,[AN]
[OpenQuote]is the divine right that Byelen[N]
gave to me to rule this land.[N]
You will love me. You will fear me.[AN]
It was my line whose grace summoned[N]
Byelen unto this world, and Orodreth[N]
prospered. In this hour, the land is mine."[AN]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
That's[Beat] quite the story, Kwame.[AN]
Abalone IX was the last emperor[N]
of the old empire, was he not?[AN]
[MidRight]
Correct, but do you[N]
know how he fell?[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
History is often a messy web of myth[N]
and half-truths, but the Book of Havarti[N]
claims blessed weapons defeated him.[A]
[MidRight]
You are as sharp as the blades that ended[N]
the empire, Miss Cleo. Yes, the legends[N]
would tell you that it was due to warriors,[AN]
wielding the power of divine weapons[N]
blessed with Byelen's own essence.[AN]
There were four weapons Havarti spoke[N]
of, though his knowledge was secondhand:[AN]
the bow of Chouwouj, the axe of Decia,[N]
the spear of Mahemen, and, mightiest[N]
of them all, the sword of Cythes.[AN]
With these weapons turned against him,[N]
Emperor Abalone IX fell in battle,[N]
and the result is what you all see now.[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
So, do you suspect that Cythes[N]
wants to use these weapons now?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I do not know, young liberators.[AN]
However, if the Cytheans wish to[N]
restore their great empire of old,[N]
they may turn to the famed weapons.[AN]
[FarLeft]
The entire continent ruled by Cytheans[Beat][N]
We can't let that happen. We all have the[N]
right to be free and live as we wish.[AN]
[MidRight]
That is why I am here with you all, now.[N]
I do not wish for the restoration[N]
of the Great Cythean Empire.[AN]
For an Orodreth controlled only[N]
by the iron grip of the Cytheans[N]
will be one that is never truly free.[AN]
With Mahemen's waning order,[N]
and Chouwouj's endless chaos,[AN]
it is you, young Liberators, who[N]
may be the only chance we have.[AN]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Not that great of a chance, are we?[N]
All we have driving us is morale and[N]
a willingness to die for liberation.[AN]
[Beat]But we have to fight.[N]
We have to find the weapons[N]
and end Cythes's tyranny.[AN]
[Left]
I don't disagree with the sentiment,[N]
but we have no idea where these[N]
weapons are, or if they still exist.[AN]
With or without these weapons,[N]
we need to make a proper plan[N]
for our next course of action.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Yes, it is wise to decide on a[N]
clear path forward, Lady Cleo.[AN]
And there are many choices available[N]
to you, daunting as that may be.[AN]
I trust you will make the correct one.[N]
But first, you two should get some rest.[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Mm, we've all earned as much.[N]
Goodnight, Sir Kwame.[AN]

They are more hopeful than I imagined.[N]
Even with the loss of their general,[N]
they continue to soldier on[Beat] Admirable.[AN]
Cleo, Loewe[Beat] how will you respond in the[N]
face of true despair? Will your youthful[N]
optimism shine a light in the darkness,[AN]
or will it be doused by the power of the[N]
Cytheans? We must all overcome difficult[N]
challenges to ascend to greatness[Beat][AN][CloseEyes]
Hm? That feeling[Beat][OpenEyes] So it's as I expected.[N]
The light in the dark[Beat] the blessing[N]
