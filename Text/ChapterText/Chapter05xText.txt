Sir Loewe, Lady Cleo![N]
We have arrived![A][X]

## Ch5xLoeweCleoTalk
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][LoadCleo][ThreeLineBox]
Loewe, we'll arrive at the base in[N]
an hour. We should prepare ourselves.[N]
[Beat]You seem out of it. What is it?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I was just thinking about the past.[N]
We've worked together for a couple years[N]
now, but it feels like I met you ages ago.[A]
[MidRight]
It does, doesn't it? Even so, I remember[N]
well the day I defected. You and Dragana[N]
alone welcomed me, among the rebels,[AN]
so I have much to thank you two for.[A]
[MidLeft]
Honestly, I didn't know what to think[N]
at first, either. A highborn woman walks[N]
in and wants to join a rebellion[Beat][AN]
Sounds like the setup to a bad joke.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
H-Highborn?[.4] To be clear,[N]
I am not a noble of any kind.[A]
[MidLeft]
Maybe so, you're no commoner either.[N]
I admit I'm curious about your past[Beat][AN]
but no matter what, you're my ally[N]
and a friend, and that's what counts.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Loewe[Beat] When our work is done,[N]
I can tell you what you wish to know.[N]
However, I do have one condition.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Oh, what's that?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
I have my own questions for you.[N]
If you answer them, then I'll return[N]
the favor. Is that acceptable?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Well, there's not much to say[Beat][N]
but alright. I'll take you up on that.[A]
[MidRight]
Excellent. For now, we must both[N]
survive until that day comes.[A][X]

## Ch5xKwameSceneMiraAlive2
[MidLeft][LoadKwame]
[MidRight][LoadMira]
Hold a moment, Kwame.[N]
Why were you watching them?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I intended to discuss the Liberators'[N]
coming plans with our commanders,[N]
but they seemed preoccupied.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Not a bad excuse for what looked like[N]
spying, but it won't work on me.[N]
I know it when I see it, Kwame.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Mm[Beat] You do seem experienced in that,[N]
considering you spied on me just now.[AN]
Perhaps a former occupation of yours,[N]
before you joined Dragana's rebellion?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Guess there's no point in hiding it.[N]
Yeah, I served as Cidor's spymaster[N]
before he bent the knee to Cythes.[AN]
It was[Beat] a bridge too far, for me,[N]
selling our country out to them.[AN]
And although I didn't plan on getting[N]
involved in the conflict to come,[N]
Kasun found a way to convince me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Everything I hear about this woman[N]
convinces me more and more of the keen[N]
loss you must all feel, with her passing.[AN]
My condolences, Captain Mira.[A]
[MidRight]
Hmph[Beat] Do you think I'm dumb?[AN]
You know nothing of our struggles,[N]
so don't bother with spewing hot air[N]
that you think I want to hear.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]A fair point. Then I'll have to[N]
allow my strategies to show my loyalty.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Better hope they do. If I see any hint[N]
of treachery, I'll root it out without[N]
remorse. Mercy is a luxury we don't have.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
As you should, Captain.[N]
I respect your dedication.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Not easily intimidated, eh?[N]
That's all I wanted to say.[N]
so I'll be on my way.[A][X]

## Ch5xKwameSceneMiraAlive3

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]It is fortunate that those two have a[N]
watchful, if abrasive, guardian. I'm sure[N]
they'll rely on her in the days to come.[AN]
The rebels may be only embers, but united,[N]
even sparks can form an inferno. Let us[N]
hope this growing flame is not doused[Beat][A][X]


## Ch5xKwameSceneMiraDead
[MidLeft][LoadKwame][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I intended to discuss our future[N]
strategic plans, but interrupting[N]
them would be callous indeed.[AN]
I doubt they desire the sympathy of[N]
an outsider like myself. Still,[N]
the Liberators' bonds are heartening.[AN]

It's good to be back. Elmhurst Island[N]
isn't much, but it keeps us out of[N]
Cythes's reach, so it's good enough.[A]
[FarRight]
Right. We know the paths well enough[N]
and have traps set all over the island.[N]
Even if occupation forces found us,[AN]
they would perish before escaping.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Well, a large part of that is Trajan[Beat][N]
That guy's a monster and a half.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Trajan?[A]

[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
Loewe, Cleo! I'm glad to see the two of[N]
you made it out alive. Where's Dragana?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Trajan, she[Beat] was imprisoned by Cidor.[N]
We almost made it out, but Cidor[N]
struck her down at the last second.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Really? Just like that, huh[Beat][N]
That dastard[Beat] He'll pay for this.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Our rescue mission failed, so the[N]
consequences lie on our shoulders.[N]
I will accept the blame-[A]
[MidLeft]
There's no point in assigning fault now.[N]
We just have to continue her legacy.[N]
[Beat]Still, what happened out there?[AN]
Last I heard, the main unit planned to[N]
attack a supply line connecting[N]
Selese and General Elias's forces.[A]
[FarRight]
Boro left our group in favor of Cidor,[N]
leaving a leadership vacuum in his wake.[N]
Then, we were ambushed by Selese forces.[A]
[MidLeft]
So we lost our leader, and even Boro[N]
abandoned us[Beat] One founder dead,[N]
and the other a traitor. Good grief[Beat][A]
[Right]
Boro also helped us escape the jails.[N]
Honestly, I'm not sure what side[N]
he's on now, or if he's even alive.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Hm[Beat] And Mira?[A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting3MiraAlive
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
[MidRight][LoadMira]
Loud enough to hear from below deck,[N]
as always[Beat] Anyway, don't worry.[AN]
Cleo and Loewe still need me while[N]
they're growing into their own,[AN]
so I won't be dying anytime soon.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha, that's a relief. If I were[N]
the only founder left of the four,[AN]
that'd be quite a burden to carry.[N]
[Beat]I'm glad that you made it back, Mira.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Dragana's words from the prisons[N]
are keeping me going, to tell the truth.[AN]
She trusted that I could protect those[N]
two, in her place[Beat] Tall task, huh?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
One that I'd leave in no one else's[N]
hands but yours.[A] Keep up the good work,[N]

She[Beat] perished in the rescue[N]
attempt. We erred in our tactics.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Even Mira has fallen? That means I'm[N]
the last of the four founders left[Beat][AN]
[Right]
If I had just reacted a second[N]
sooner, then maybe[Beat] Mira[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
Blaming yourself won't change anything,[N]
will it? Put it out of your mind, Loewe.[AN]
If she died protecting the two of you,[N]
then I'm sure she died satisfied.[AN]
We just have to honor her and Dragana's[N]
memory[Beat] That's all we can do, now.[A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting3MiraCaptured

four founders who can fight[Beat][N]
It seems the mission didn't go well.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I can't argue that point.[N]
We lost one of our best fighters.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
No, at the very least, she may still[N]
be alive. We'll just have to rescue[N]
her at the earliest opportunity.[A]

[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, my apologies. I am Kwame, a[N]
strategist who seeks to halt the[N]
Cythean advance. For that purpose,[AN]
I paid for this vessel, and its[N]
crew have decided to work with[N]
us after a Selesian attack.[A]
[Left]
You have my gratitude, then. Had you[N]
not intervened, I'm not sure when[N]
these two would have made it back.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
I will accept it with honor. Sir Loewe[N]
spoke highly of you before our arrival.[A]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
Ha, did he now? Glad to hear it. Care[N]
Care to show him how great I am, Loewe?[AN]
I've got a training blade with your name[N]
on it, and we could use an audience.[A][ToggleSmile]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Sorry, Trajan, but we don't have[N]
time for a spar. Kwame can fill you in,[N]
but we gained a lot of new information.[A]

I'm relying on you two to handle[N]

you have a home to come back to.[AN]
[Beat]Given that, what do you three[N]
think our next move should be?[AN]
I have my own ideas if you're not sure,[N]
but making the move's up to you all,[N]
so the final decision should be, too.[A]
[Left]
The obvious target is Selese.[AN][CSS]

[Right][ClearFace]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[Event]
[FarLeft][LoadTrajan]
[Left][LoadLoewe]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[Left]
Their location provides the[N]
Cytheans with a foothold in Decia.[AN]
If we take that position ourselves,[N]
we'll gain more recruits out of Selese's[N]
citizens and rid ourselves of Cidor.[A]
[Right]
Perhaps, but after our escape, isn't it[N]
likely that Cidor asks for Cythes's aid?[AN]
If the empire agrees, and General Elias[N]
uses all the forces at his disposal,[N]
trying to take Selese is a death wish.[AN]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Well then, what's your suggestion?[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Seeking out Mahemen's rebels could give[N]
us more information about the weapons.[AN][CSS]

ambitions may yield new allies.[A][CSS]

[FarRight][ClearFace]
[Event]
[FarLeft][LoadTrajan]
[Left][LoadLoewe]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Cleo, we can't rely on the promises of[N]
Chouwouj's warlords without their king,[N]
so going there's no more than a gamble.[AN]
And Mahemen? Between the journey there[N]
and trekking through its deserts,[N]
that's gonna be a long, long trip.[AN]
Even if we gain something out of it,[N]
who knows what Decia'll look like when[N]
we get back? The people here need us now![A]
[FarRight]
I am of the same mind as Sir Loewe,[AN]
regarding Mahemen. That said, a direct[N]
assault on Cidor's territory is no more[N]
than suicide with the band we have now.[AN]
Chouwouj may be the best option we have,[N]
with the lowest risks of the bunch.[AN]
Many whisper that a member of their[N]
royal family survived, so if we aided[N]
them in regaining their rightful throne,[AN]
perhaps they would do us a good turn[N]
and make our battle in Decia easier.[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
I'm against it. Way too many ifs[Beat][N]
You got any ideas, Trajan?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hm[Beat] You mentioned the[N]
the axe of Decia in your report.[AN]
I was a knight of House Freyse once,[N]
serving them alongside Dragana[N]
to protect southern Decia.[AN][CSS]

[Event]
[FarLeft][LoadTrajan]
[Left][LoadLoewe]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[FarLeft]
There's an old tale of an ancient[N]
axe stored beneath the ground,[N]
passed down from lord to heir.[AN]
It might be just a rumor, but I can't[N]
think of a likelier place to hide[N]
a divine weapon than a noble's lair.[A]
[Right]
If so, why didn't Lord Joakim[N]
use it against Cythes? Perhaps[N]
it would have saved his life.[AN]
[FarLeft]
His forces were outnumbered, ten to one.[AN]
No weapon could bridge that gulf,[N]
even if he could have unearthed it[N]
and made some use out of the thing.[AN]
[Beat]There's one more important detail.[N]
Last week, I received a report[N]
on rebel activity in Freyse.[AN]
It appears that Joakim's heir, Korovai,[N]
survived, and he marches with an army[N]
to reclaim Castle Freyse for himself.[AN]
That said, his odds of success are low[N]
enough that his advisor's decided to ask[N]
for our aid in ridding them of Cythes.[AN]
I held off on answering til Dragana[N]
came back, which means the decision[N]
is up to you three. What do you say?[AN]
[Right]
If we leave this heir to their[N]
own devices, they may perish,[AN]
but if we help them, they could[N]
prove a useful ally for our cause.[N]
The answer, to me, seems clear.[AN]
[FarRight]
Very true. Even if we cannot find the[N]
axe, House Freyse has many followers[N]
even now that may fight for our cause.[A]
[Left]
Freyse's people are Decian, too,[N]
so I'm for it. Let's sail back[N]
east and make our way to Freyse![AN]
[FarLeft]
Sounds good to me. I may not be able[N]
to come with you, but you can have[N]
[Red]two[Red] members of our reserve corps here.[AN]
The ones out there volunteered to fight[N]
on the frontlines, so take your pick.[N]
I'm sure they'll all be useful to you.[AN]
[Right]
Thank you. Loewe, we should go survey[N]
the potential recruits. Sir Kwame,[N]
do you mind waiting for us to choose?[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Not at all. Please choose wisely[N]
to maximize our chances at victory.[A]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]By the way, I took a look at your[N]
boat while you all were sailing in.[AN]
It's pretty beat up to take to Freyse,[N]
so how about I lend you a new one?[AN]
Just talk to me when you're done,[N]
and I'll get everything sorted.[AN]
[Right]
Thank you, Trajan. Now, let's see[N]
these volunteers for ourselves[Beat][A][X]

[MidLeft]
We have much to talk about,[N]
but not in front of him.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I'm sorry, Loewe. Could you step[N]
away for a moment? Varga is[Beat][N]
a friend of mine from Cythes.[A]
[FarRight]
Yeah, I remember that from the jails.[N]
A [OpenQuote]friend", huh? [Beat]Well, whatever.[N]
Talk to me when you're done.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[Right]
Well, now that he's gone, you need[N]
hold nothing back. Why were you[N]
masquerading as a Selesian guard?[A]
[MidLeft]
Your brother asked me to investigate[N]
your disappearance and see if you[N]
still lived. And so, I did.[AN]
[Right]
Well, I suppose that's reason enough[N]
to look for me, but again, why were[N]
you there during our mission?[A]
[MidLeft]
I heard of Dragana's capture and a[N]
rebel strategist that used Cythean[N]
maneuvers. Who else could it be?[AN]
Besides[Beat] I know you well, Cleo.[N]
You, deserting? Unsurprising.[AN]
[Right][LoadCleoAngry]
Can you blame me? This occupation is[N]
unjust! Emperor Orfeas commands[N]
that we take over the continent,[AN]
and anyone who challenges us[N]
is lucky to keep their lives,[N]
let alone their homes or food.[AN]
I cannot begin to fathom his motives,[N]
save that they are morally bankrupt.[A]
[MidLeft]
What of your brother, then?[N]
Is he [OpenQuote]morally bankrupt",[N]
helming the occupation in Orfeas's name?[AN]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[Beat]I don't know. Growing up, I thought[N]
that Elias knew everything, and if I only[N]
followed the path he laid out for me,[AN]
I too could be of service to my country.[N]
Now, I can scarcely stomach the notion,[N]
but what does he see that I cannot?[A]
[MidLeft]
I have no answer that you don't,[N]
but remember something, Cleo.[N]
A single man doesn't move nations.[AN]
Fear, greed, hope[Beat] Elias has his[N]
own motive for following Orfeas's will.[N]
The only way you can find it out?[AN]
Asking the man himself, I'd guess.[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]I have much to contemplate,[N]
but now that you have found me,[N]
what do you intend to tell Elias?[A]
[MidLeft]
That you are alive and number among[N]
the rebels. I already sent a letter[N]
while we were in Port Neufchatel.[AN]
Beyond that, I'll continue to protect[N]
you. Elias asked as much, but[Beat][N]
I'd have done it either way.[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
I see[Beat] Thank you, Varga. I am[N]
counting on your service, as always.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hmph, don't thank me yet. You've grown[N]

you require my training once more.[A]

[Right][ThreeLineBox]
No, not particularly. Cleo, you mind if[N]
I talk to this guy alone? I've got some[N]
questions that I want him to answer.[A]
[FarRight]
I have no issue with that. Looking[N]
over our supplies before we leave seems[N]
prudent, so I'll go do that instead.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Hm[Beat] Keeping secrets may cause[N]
her to harbor distrust, little lion.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Little lion? What does that mean?[N]
And for the record, you're the last[N]
person who should talk about trust.[A]
[MidLeft]
Ah, my apologies. I once knew a woman[N]
of Mahemen who reminds me of you, with[N]
bladework sharper than a lion's fang.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]You did spend time in Mahemen, then.[N]
Do you recognize this sword? It belonged[N]
to my mother before Cythes invaded.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]It is difficult to believe that any[N]
commoner could have such a blade.[N]
Who exactly were your parents, Sir Loewe?[A]
[Right]
Can you drop the [OpenQuote]Sir", already?[N]
It's making me uncomfortable.[AN]
My father studied Mahemeni history, but[N]
my mother didn't speak much of her past.[N]
Her peerless swordplay spoke for itself.[A]
[MidLeft]
A scholar, eh? I suppose that is how[N]
you knew of the Book of Havarti.[N]
And what is your mother's name?[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Catrin. Does that ring any bells?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]The name does feel familiar,[N]
but I can't place it at the moment.[N]
Age dulls the mind, I suppose.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]A likely story. If you won't answer,[N]
then you've only wasted my time.[A]
[MidLeft]
Hold a moment. There is[N]
one thing I can tell you.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Spit it out, then.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That blade doesn't appear to be one of[N]
the four blessed weapons. However[Beat][N]
it does have some kind of enchantment.[AN]
Carry it with caution, Loewe.[A]
[Right]
I'll keep that in mind, then.[N]
If you [OpenQuote]remember" anything else,[N]
let me know. Now, I'm off.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Catrin, your son has inherited that[N]
fiery disposition of yours. Further,[N]
that blade[Beat] I'm certain of it now.[AN]

that I sensed before disappears[Beat][N]

Oh, you two. Have we[N]

[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
The heir of Freyse has returned and[N]

We decided to assist their effort.[A]
[Left]
Freyse[Beat] It's a shame that General[N]
Dragana couldn't live to see the day[N]

All we can do now is make[N]
sure her death isn't in vain.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Agreed. We owe her that much.[N]
Still, I have to admit that[N]
I'm curious about this heir.[AN]
Before today, we knew nothing[N]
of them, save their name.[N]
Lord Joakim was a cautious man.[A]

Whatever they're like, I just hope we[N]

I'll continue to back you two up.[N]
Iskra, you will too, right?[A]

Of course! Someone has to make sure[N]
Loewe doesn't get in over his head.[A]
[Right]
Make sure you watch out for yourself[N]
first, Iskra. I'm just fine on my own.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
You don't need to worry about me.[N]
I'm way stronger now, right?[A]
[Right]
You're not as weak, so from[N]

Maybe if my teacher would hurry up[N]

I'd have surpassed you already.[A]

in Decia, Sir Elias. Or[Beat][AN]
Should I call you the Vermillion Knight?[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Just Elias is fine, my lady. Our knightly[N]
titles are a bit embarrassing, to be frank.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Very well, Elias. And of course, my[N]
grandfather has spoken often of the[N]
Auric Lion, guardian of Cythes.[AN]
You have my greatest respect.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
I appreciate it, but I only do my[N]
duty in Orfeas's name. Nothing more.[A]
[Right]
So, uh[Beat] What did you want[N]
to tell me, Your Majesty?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, yes. I received a letter from Duke[N]
Cidor of Selese, requesting aid from[N]
Cythes in dealing with a few rebels.[AN]
They have evaded his grasp and caused[N]
him no end of problems, as he says it.[N]
What do you make of the situation?[A]
[Right]
The Decian Liberators are a resourceful[N]
group. That he struggles to end their[N]
threat, once and for all, is of no surprise.[A]
[Left]
Hmm[Beat] Why did he not send the letter to[N]
you, instead? You oversee the occupation,[N]
so surely a direct request was unnecessary.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]Even if he is nominally on our side,[AN]
I've no respect for traitors. Perhaps[N]
he felt uncomfortable asking me himself.[A]
[Left]
Traitor he may be, but his cooperation[N]
with us greatly reduced the bloodshed[N]
necessary to cow Decia into submission.[AN]
His defeat would form chaos in the[N]
region that cannot be allowed. Elias,[N]
send as many troops as Cidor requires.[AN]
Lead them yourself, if it is necessary[N]
for stability to remain in the region.[N]
Our guiding hand must remain steady.[AN]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] [Beat][A]
[Right]
[Beat]As you wish. Is that all, then?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Indeed[Beat] Perhaps this did not require a[N]
personal meeting, but I also wanted to[N]
see your progress since your induction.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Today, I see before me a fine knight,[N]
worthy of his accolades and place as[N]
the youngest member of the Order of Iris.[A]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
I am[Beat] humbled by your praise,[N]
my emperor, and I can only[N]
hope to live up to it.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
I trust that you will. Now, I must[N]
attend another meeting. Coralia,[N]
you may return to your studies.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Yes, Grandfather.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Elias, Leonidas[Beat] do not forget our noble[N]
purpose. What we do is for the people[N]
of Orodreth. May Byelen guide us all.[A][X]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I have my own duties, so I'll[N]
leave as well. Elias, try to use the[N]
main entrance this time, would you?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Sorry, but no promises there.[A][ToggleSmile]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Well, alright[Beat] Stay safe, son.[N]
Tell me if Cleo resurfaces, please.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
You can count on me, Father.[A][X]


## Ch5xEliasCoraliaTalk
[MidRight][LoadElias][ThreeLineBox]
Sorry for the lie, too. I can't tell[N]
him that Cleo's an enemy of Cythes[Beat][N]
I'll have to try and convince her,[AN]
before Father finds out. It'd break his[N]
heart, knowing the honorable Cythean[N]
he raised isn't what he hoped she'd be.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Nerube, you ready to roll?[A]
[FarFarRight]
Gwoaaa[Beat][A]
[MidRight]
Always complaints with you, isn't it?[A]
[MidLeft][LoadCoralia]
Are you[Beat] talking to your dragon?[A]
[MidRight]
Is that strange?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
W-Well, no, but I've never seen[N]
such a display. Why bother speaking[N]
to a beast that cannot ever reply?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Well, what we're doing in Decia is[N]
contemptible to anyone with a conscience.[N]
Maybe it's driven me insane, my lady.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] [Beat][A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Not used to honesty in the royal court?[AN]
Orfeas's orders have resulted in[N]
death and despair across Orodreth.[N]
No one can deny it, except us Cytheans.[A]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat] I never imagined a knight of your[N]
caliber would flout such disobedience.[N]
Our efforts in expansion are-[A]
[MidRight]
Save your acting for someone who'll[N]
believe it.[A] The emperor might not[N]
see it, but I'm not blind enough to miss[N]
a viper slithering among garden snakes.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Hmph. Then humor my bite, Elias.[N]
If you detest my grandfather's actions,[N]
then why are you executing his will?[A]
[MidRight]
My feelings don't change what we have[N]
to do. In order to avert the coming[N]
catastrophe, his plans must succeed.[AN]
[Beat]I know of no other way, I'm afraid.[A]
[MidLeft]
W-What? I don't understand[Beat] Why tell[N]
me all of this if you suspect my motives?[N]
And what [OpenQuote]catastrophe" do you mean?[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Who knows? You'll have to figure[N]
all that out yourself. Anyway, I've got[N]
a job to do, so I'll be taking my leave.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
W-Wait! Hold on, I still have-[A][X]

[Beat]Questions.[A] The Vermillion Knight[N]
is not exactly as I thought he would be,[N]
but perhaps this is an unexpected boon.[AN]
If I am to unravel the truth of the lost[N]
history of the Reclamation Wars, Havarti's[N]
texts, and Grandfather's actions[Beat][AN]
I will require someone on the inside.[N]
Elias's resolve wavers[Beat] Perhaps[N]
he is exactly who I need for this[Beat][A][X]

Father Matthias![AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Lady Cleo! Sir Loewe! It's great[N]
to see you both hale and hearty![AN]
[Right]
Oh please, Father.[N]
Spare us the formalities.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Same for you both.[N]
Matthias is already enough.[AN]
[FarRight]
I assume you're here[N]
to offer your services, Father.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Y-yes, that's correct. Lady[N]
Dragana did so much for us, and[Beat][AN]
I would like to ease the burden[N]
of our army in any way I can.[AN]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
I've heard that you'd spend a very long[N]
time tending to the sickly without[N]
taking proper care of yourself, Father.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, y-yes[Beat] B-but I assure you I won't[N]
be a burden! Aside from my healing arts,[N]
I have a penchant for holy magic.[AN]
I can at least[Beat] fend for myself,[N]
if you're worried. I promise![AN][X]

## MatthiasPickDialogue
[MidRight][LoadCleo][ToggleMouthMove]

## MatthiasAcceptedDialogue

I truly hope I can be of service.[AN][X]

I-It's fine. I can still[N]
make myself useful here.[AN][X]
