## Ch6_WM_Text
Decided on aiding House Freyse's lord, Korovai,[N]
the Liberators set out from Elmhurst Island.[AN]
Although their ultimate destination is Freyse,[N]
they first lay anchor at the Yuria Islands.[AN][Event]
Known as the trading crossroads of Orodreth,[AN]
the islands, over centuries, became a haven[N]
for those tired of the mainland's bloody wars.[AN]
Instead, most disputes are settled in one way:[AN]
battling it out in the Grand Oceanic Arena,[N]
a holy ground for those devoted to bloodsport.[AN]
Here, Loewe and Cleo intend to meet Iberis,[N]
Korovai's envoy, to plan their next steps...[AN][X]

[MidRight][LoadLoewe][ThreeLineBox]
Man[Beat] Could this get any more boring?[N]
Why'd I have to be the one stuck[N]
watching the boat with you, Kwame?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Come now, Loewe. Safekeeping our vessel[N]
is important work while the others[N]
search for Lady Iberis in town, yes?[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, right! I bet they're all having[N]
fun out there, while I'm stuck here[N]
playing cards with an old man.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hmph! Well, if it pleases you,[N]
would you rather I tell a story?[N]
Long ago, a Chouwoujian prince-[AN]
[MidRight]
Not another one of your stories![N]
I've heard enough of them over the[N]
past week to last me a lifetime.[AN]
[Beat]Forget this. The anchor's set,[N]
and we're right next to the arena.[N]
I'm going for a quick flight, Kwame.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Loewe, are you sure this is wise?[N]
If Lady Cleo were to find out-[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Relax, I'll be back in a couple[N]
minutes after I see what's going[N]
on at the Grand Oceanic Arena.[AN]
I'm leaving the boat to you, Kwame![A][X]

## Ch6BeginningScene2
[MidLeft][LoadKwame][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]What a tempestuous young man.[N]
Wait, that fellow in the distance[N]
looks like- Loewe, you've done it now![AN]
I see little point in trying to stop[N]
the man[Beat] I should hide, for now.[N]
Loewe and Lady Cleo can handle this[Beat][A][X]

## Ch6BeginningScene3
[MidLeft][LoadMcCallum][ThreeLineBox]
Hmph, someone was fool enough to leave[N]
their ship alone? Must be a visitor,[N]
not an islander, or they'd know better.[AN]
Well, this'll be the last ship I steal.[N]
I'm about tired of the pirate's life[Beat][AN]
This ship's a chance to leave it behind[N]
and become a new man, the one I needed[N]
as a lad. Call myself something new[Beat][AN]
But first, I need to get this ship movin'.[AN]
Then, it won't be too long before the[N]
islands fade away from my view,[N]
and it won't be too soon, neither.[AN][X]

Ladies and gentlemen of[N]
the Grand Oceanic Arena![AN]
Three cheers to Cromar,[N]
our latest champion![A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Congratulations, my friend![AN]
Your fighting style is impressive[N]
indeed, to pierce through my armor.[N]
I hope to see you again, Cromar.[AN]

[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Not a friendly fellow, are you, Cromar?[AN]
Well, no matter. Here's your reward:[N]
Umbralium, one of the rarest materials[N]
in Orodreth, found only in these islands![AN]
Perhaps you can already sense the power[N]
of Byelen resting within the stone[Beat][AN]
Come again, and I'll have another type[N]
ready for you, so long as you win![N]
But for now[Beat] use this well, champion![A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I'll use it as I please, Barod.[N]
I'd hoped for a stronger material,[N]
but this'll do the job. Farewell.[AN][X]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Congratulations on your victory, Cromar.[N]
[Beat]As for the man you're looking for,[N]
he's surfaced just as you expected.[AN]
He appears to be stealing a ship[N]
in the northwest[Beat] Contemptible.[N]
But are you certain you want to do this?[AN]
[MidRight]
I've never been more certain of anything[N]
in my life. McCallum[Beat] The swine![AN]
He took everything from me, Leina.[N]
And until I avenge my sister's death,[N]
I can't move forward with my life.[AN][CloseEyes]
I can't move forward with you[Beat][N][OpenEyes]
So don't follow me, Leina.[N]
McCallum will die, by my hand![AN][X]

Here, my reward from the arena.[AN]
I trust this'll be enough[N]
for you to work your magic?[AN]
[MidRight]
Along with the thousand gold?[N]
Yes, it'll do quite nicely.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Tch[Beat] Fine, here you go.[N]
This better be worth it, Veid.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh, it will be[Beat] And done![AN]
Rejoice, Cromar. This may be the most[N]
refined piece of Umbralium to exist.[AN]
It hurts me to part with it, but[Beat][N]
may the darkness guide your blade.[AN]
Now, I'll be off to the tavern.[N]
Good luck in your quest, Cromar[Beat][AN][X]

[MidLeft]
McCallum![N]
Today, you answer for your crimes.[AN]
[MidRight]
Eh? What's your deal, lad?[N]
I'm in the middle of something.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
A murderer[Beat] and a thief.[N]
Taker of lives, taker of ships.[AN]
It's up to me to dispense justice.[N]
For you, McCallum, killed my sister,[N]
and took her away from this world![AN]
I've given it all up just[N]
for this one moment[Beat][N]
McCallum[Beat] prepare to die![AN]
[MidRight]
Quite a speech, lad, but I don't[N]
know what you're talkin' about.[N]
I won't deny I've had a rough history.[AN]
In just this life, I've done much.[N]
Kill. Pillage. Loot. Steal.[N]
You name the crime, I've done it.[AN]
I won't bore you with my upbringing.[N]
I'll be damned if I continue[N]
to let the past define me.[AN]
But if you're here to stop me,[N]
then I can't outrun it[Beat] Fine.[AN]
Cromar[Beat] that was your name, aye?[AN]
Come at me, lad! Today is my last[N]
day as McCallum, the Dread Pirate![AN]
Fear the axe that has cleaved[N]
countless who dared challenge me![A][X]

## Ch6BeginningScene10
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
Man, that was a good fight![N]
That Cromar guy was something else.[AN]
Wish I could ask him how he got[N]
strong enough to fight like that,[AN]
but I'd better get back to the ship,[N]
or I'll never hear the end of it.[A][X]

## Ch6BeginningScene11
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
Huh? What the hell's Cromar doing[N]
on our boat, and who's that other guy?[AN]
I don't see Kwame anywhere, either[Beat][N]
Well, hopefully he made it below deck.[AN]
I have to find Cleo and the others![A][X]

## Ch6BeginningScene12
[Left][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
Cleo! They[Beat] They've got our boat![N]
Is everyone else ready to fight?[AN]
[Left]
Settle down, Loewe. Who's they?[N]
And how did this happen?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Uh, that's[Beat] Well, a pirate and[N]
an arena fighter are duking it[N]
out on our ship, right now.[AN]
It's my fault. I flew off for[N]
no more than a few minutes,[N]
and this happens. Damn it all![AN]
[Left]
There'll be time to beat yourself[N]
up over it later, Loewe. For now,[N]
let's handle the situation together.[AN]
[FarLeft][LoadIberis][TwoLineBox]
You're the other leader? I must say,[N]
my confidence in you all has wavered.[AN]
Losing your ship to unwashed heathens?[N]
What kind of buffoonery is this?[AN]
[MidRight][LoadLoeweAngry]
Excuse me? And who are you to-[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
This is Lord Korovai's envoy, Loewe.[AN]
Iberis. And at the moment, she has[N]
every right to doubt our capabilities,[N]
but we can prove them. Through action.[AN]
Let's take care of this quickly, before-[A][X]

## Ch6BeginningScene13
[MidLeft][LoadDraken]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Wahaha! Look at me lads,[N]
I'm the captain now![N]
It's time to celebrate.[AN]
And what better gift than the Azurium[N]
that daft noble dropped in our laps?[AN]
With its powers in our grasp now,[N]
the waves 'round here are no more to us[N]
than solid ground is to landlubbers.[AN]
Even if we don't have enough of them[N]
gems for everyone, we've got plenty[N]
to take over the islands ourselves,[AN]
and do what McCallum could never do![N]
Now, brothers, hear me and charge![AN]
Shuck their shells like clams![N]
Crack their claws like lobsters![N]
Show the islanders our might![A][X]

## Ch6BeginningScene14
[Left][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
Seriously, more pirates?[N]
We can't catch a break![AN]
[Left]
That's only if you think dealing with[N]
them is our responsibility, Loewe.[AN]
The Yuria Islands has seen pirates[N]
before, and it'll see them again.[AN]
Let them handle the rest here[N]
while we take back our ship.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadLoeweAngry]
You want to let these scum run[N]
rampant right in front of us?[AN]
By the time anyone responds,[N]
the damage'll be done, Cleo![AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
We have a mission to do, Loewe,[N]
one that you've already jeopardized[N]
by leaving Kwame alone back there.[AN][LoadCleoAngry]
Do you intend to hold us back more[N]
and ruin any chance we have, all so[N]
you can say you did the right thing?[A]
[FarLeft][LoadIberis]
Well, well. Looks like you Liberators[N]
aren't so tight-knit, after all.[AN]
It seems I'll have to report these[N]
frequent issues back to Lord Korovai[Beat][N]
That is, unless you assuage my concerns.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[Left][LoadCleo]
[Beat]What do you have in mind?[AN]
Your cooperation is important to us,[N]
so we'll do anything, within reason,[N]
to secure it. You have my word.[AN]
[FarLeft]
As it happens, the pirates that just[N]
showed up stole valuable gemstones[N]
from me. I want them to pay for it.[AN]
Defeat their leader, and take his beloved[N]
ship for yourselves. That'll be enough[N]
for me to consider you lot competent.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Not like I need a motive to do the[N]
right thing. What about you, Cleo?[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]Fine, you win, Loewe. Like always.[N]
Is that what you wanted to hear?[AN]
[MidRight]
What? No, I[Beat] Forget it.[N]
Let's just get this over with.[AN]
[FarLeft]
I'll watch your handiwork from afar.[N]
Do not disappoint me again, Liberators.[AN][X]

All of you are the Liberators, yes?[N]
U-Um[Beat] Is now a bad time?[AN]
[FarRight]
Yes, but it can't get much worse.[N]
Get on with it. What do you want?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I'm Leina, formerly a maiden of[N]
Chouwouj, now traveling the world,[N]
and I'm sympathetic to your cause.[AN]
I'd like to join your band, if possible.[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
I appreciate your politeness, at least.[N][ToggleSmile]
Still, why would a lady like yourself[N]
want to join a rebel group like us?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Cythes is as much an enemy to Chouwouj[N]
as they are to you, so that's part of it.[AN]
Otherwise[Beat] The man named Cromar,[N]
on your boat? He's my partner,[AN]
and I want to end this duel[N]
before something happens to him.[AN]
[Right]
Sounds like we've got a common goal,[N]
then. Any qualms with her joining, Loewe?[AN]
[FarRight]
Nah, we need all the help we can get.[N]
Just don't die out there, alright?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Don't worry, I can defend myself.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Anyway, Cromar's rage will fade[N]
if McCallum dies, but I don't[N]
want Cromar to give into his anger[Beat][AN]
If you can, please help me find[N]
another way to stop their duel![A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
We'll do the best that we can, Leina,[N]
but if worst comes to worst, I can't[N]
imagine anyone will miss a pirate.[AN]
Now, to arms! Let's make this quick![A][X]

## Ch6ArenaHint
Put [Red]3[Red] units in the green squares[N]
to enter or exit the arena. Once they[N]
leave, the arena will close its doors,[N]
disallowing any future participation.[AN]
Your units will be healed after every[N]
victory in the arena, and on the next[N]
turn, a new round of enemies will arrive.[AN]
If the red line is crossed, Barod will[N]
get very angry, resulting in a [Red]Game Over[Red].[A][X]

It ain't great, but the Yuria Islands[N]

That is, fools who don't know that the[N]

Is it? When you lived in Cythes,[N]

they spread across the continent.[AN]

Well, yes, but the treatment a Cythean[N]
receives compared to that of a Decian[N]
citizen is very different, Sir Kwame.[AN]
I've seen for myself what it looks like,[N]
so it's hard to imagine that people[N]
would spurn House Freyse's resurgence.[AN]
[MidRight]
Speaking from my travels, the common man[N]
cares little about who sits on the throne[N]
and cares much about the effect on them.[AN]
If Cythes ruling them has not harmed[N]
the people of Shagahn, why should they[N]
jump to risk their lives in rebellion?[AN]

[Beat]It hasn't harmed them yet, you mean.[N]
But if we don't liberate them ourselves,[N]

Though honestly, after meeting this[N]

Lord Korovai's rule will be for them.[AN]
Still, anything beats the status quo,[N]

We can honor General Dragana's will.[AN]

you'd have to be crazy to live here.[AN]

[MidRight]
[Beat]Our mission is to liberate Decia,[N]

What purpose would fighting here serve,[N]
except depleting our limited forces[N]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox][LoadLoeweAngry]
We'd be doing the right thing![N]
Do you need a "purpose" for that?[AN]

We're not traveling knight errants,[N]
doing the [OpenQuote]right thing" wherever we go.[N]
We're not heroes. We're Liberators.[AN]
And that means making the decisions[N]
that bring us closer and closer[N]
to achieving our goals, right?[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[Beat]I get the logic, but something rubs[N]
me the wrong way about it, Cleo.[N]
It comes off kinda[Beat] heartless.[AN]
[MidRight]
It's not easy for me either,[N]
Loewe, but think of it like this:[AN]
If someone died today, fighting pirates[N]
that aren't even a threat to Decia,[N]
what would the others think of that?[AN]
Did their comrade die in the service[N]
of liberation? Or did they die[N]
as a result of our own whims?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Alright, I get your point, Cleo.[N]
I just know that, if it were me,[N]
I'd have wanted someone to save me.[AN]
[Beat]Just like Dragana did, all those[N]
years ago, when she reached out her hand.[N]
I have[Beat] No, I want to pay that forward.[AN]

for the other Liberators, so I'll take[N]
