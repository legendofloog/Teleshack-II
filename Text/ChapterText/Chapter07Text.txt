Having completed their rendezvous with Iberis,[N]
the Liberators now have their next mission:[AN]
freeing Shagahn from the clutches of Cythes[N]
at the request of House Freyse's lord, Korovai.[AN][Event]
At last taking the offensive, Cleo and Loewe[N]
sail with pride and anxiety in their hearts...[A][X]

I will ask you one more time.[N]
We need those supplies.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
What gives you the right?[N]
Our village needs this[N]
harvest for the winter.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]The right? My birthright, girl![N]
These lands belong to me and[N]
House Freyse, not Cythean soldiers.[AN]
As citizens of Freyse, you should[N]
be honoured to provide for our[N]
cause: driving those bastards out![A]
[MidRight]
What have you damned nobles ever[N]
done for us beside take and take?[N]
At least Cythes lets us keep our rice![AN]
If you mean to threaten us like a common[N]
bandit, then we'll treat you like one.[N]
You'll not have our harvest, wretch![A]
[MidLeft]
I thought it might come to this[Beat][N]
If you will not give to the cause,[N]
then you are dogs of the Empire![AN]
Men! Forward! Crush these[N]
scum before Freyse's might![A][X]

Hmph[Beat] Putting my life on the[N]

Nothing's changed, eh Epony?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You are the heir of House Freyse[N]
now, Korovai, so something has.[AN]
That is, picking fights like that[N]
will ruin everything if you fail.[N]
You would do well to remember that.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Then what do you suggest we do?[AN]
As far as I see it, we've got no[N]
other way to take Shagahn's militia.[N]
Do we have to back down after all?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Of course not. As it happens,[N]
I have been in contact with some[N]
allies to bear the risk for us.[AN]
If all goes well, then we will have[N]
our supplies soon enough, along[N]
with new allies for the cause.[AN]
But if they fail to prove victorious[N]
before Cythean reinforcements arrive,[N]
then they can serve as our decoy,[AN]
if nothing else[Beat] Either way, we win,[N]
so long as you keep your cool.[N]
Am I understood, Lord Korovai?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I hear you loud and clear, Epony.[N]
If that's how it is, then fine by me,[N]
as long as these [OpenQuote]allies" do their part.[AN][X]

That's Lady Iberis to you, Decian.[N]
I expect the minimum from a commoner.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]LADY Iberis, these are the[N]
Cytheans you talked about?[AN]
They don't look like any army[N]
I've ever seen. Too disorganized.[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
They must not have expected our arrival.[N]
Listen to me, Liberators: those of them[N]
who aren't Cythean soldiers are worse,[AN]
traitorous turncoats who have sold[N]
themselves to their occupiers[N]
and turn their blades on House Freyse.[AN]
After all we've done for them[Beat] Hmph![AN]
[Right]
So some of these people aren't even[N]
Cytheans? Why should we fight Decians,[N]
instead of trying to talk it over?[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]Try thinking with that head of yours,[N]
Loewe. Lord Korovai already tried to[N]
reason with them, magnanimous as he is.[AN]
What do you think happened, looking[N]
at all those glares directed at us?[N]
Are you expecting a damned tea party?[AN]
[FarLeft]
I suspect Lady Iberis is correct here,[N]
Loewe. If we mean to disembark,[N]
a battle is surely inevitable.[AN]
And even were we to show them mercy,[N]
this would open us up to being[N]
attacked later by those we spared.[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Fine, I get it. But our demands had[N]
better be met in return, understand?[AN]
[Left]
That's not for me or you to decide.[N]
Remember your place, rebel.[A]
[Right][LoadLoeweAngry]
You[Beat]![A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Loewe, calm down and let me handle this.[AN][Right][LoadLoewe][FarRight]
Lady Iberis, we're partners in freeing[N]
Decia. Partners trust each other, yes?[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Partners? Lord Korovai is your superior,[N]
and I am of noble blood. You all should-[AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Alright, if that's how you want to act,[N]
then let's talk about that man there,[N]
with the ornate armor at the gates.[AN]
Your lord's [OpenQuote]noble blood" gushes out[N]
onto the grass as we speak, Lady Iberis.[N]
Which of us needs the other, right now?[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]Fine. You've made your point clear.[AN]
I will do everything I can to convince[N]
my lord of your utility to our cause,[N]
so long as you do everything to save him.[AN]
[FarRight]
Hm[Beat] Good enough. But if we find his[N]
terms lacking, then we'll turn around[N]
and leave you all to your own devices.[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Sounds good to me. Also[Beat] Iberis,[N]
are you actually getting ready to fight?[AN]
I was starting to think that your armor[N]
and tomes were all just for show.[AN]
[Left]
It's Lady- ugh, forget it.[N]
Yes, of course I am, knave![AN]
Do you think I'd leave Lord Korovai[N]
to the wolves and rely only on you?[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
I did actually think that,[N]
but hey, I'm glad to be wrong.[AN]
Listen to our commands,[N]
and you'll be just fine.[AN]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Once we save Lord Korovai,[N]
I'll never follow them again.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
And I will keep an eye on the boat,[N]
as per usual. Loewe, Cleo, make sure[N]
to prioritize both of our objectives:[AN]
seizing Shagahn's center of command[N]
and cutting a path to Lord Korovai.[N]
Splitting our forces may be wise.[AN]
[FarRight]
Noted. It'll be more efficient,[N]
but we'll have to be careful[N]
not to overextend while separated[Beat][AN]
Well, I know we can handle it. Now,[N]
let's save Lord Korovai and show[N]
House Freyse why they need us![A][X]

don't take a single step in our village.[A]

Excellent work today, Liberators.[N]
Truly, you exceeded all of my hopes,[N]
and I would be glad to call you allies.[AN]
[Right]
You'd better be, after we saved your[N]
lord's hide and cleaned up your mess.[AN]
Seriously, you couldn't take down[N]
a force of barely trained militia?[N]
Iberis said you were our superiors.[AN]
[Left]
Oh, looks like our savior's got an[N]
attitude! For your information,[N]
they got a cheap shot in on me.[AN]
Otherwise, I'd have taken them out[N]
myself in half the time. Got that?[AN]
[Right]
Really? Not how it looked to me.[N]
From where I'm standing, you-[AN]
[FarRight]
Enough, Loewe! We didn't come here[N]
to bicker back and forth, did we?[AN]
[Beat]I apologize for his temper,[N]
Lord Korovai. We've lost someone[N]
very important to us recently.[AN]
Everyone's a bit on edge here.[AN]
[Left]
Hmph[Beat] Fine, let's leave it at that.[N]
So, where's Iberis at exactly?[N]
She didn't die on the way, did she?[A][X]

[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Right here, cousin! I did just as[N]
you asked and brought the Liberators.[N]
And I even fought with them, too![AN]
Their fighting style is barbaric,[N]
but let no one say that Iberis[N]
of House Freyse balks at danger![AN]
[Beat]And I suppose they helped, as well.[A]
[Left]
Color me surprised. I never thought[N]
that you'd give them so much credit,[N]
They must have impressed you, eh?[AN]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Er, I wouldn't-[A]
[FarRight]
[Beat] [Beat][A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I wouldn't disagree! Yes, their[N]
prowess is quite[Beat] remarkable.[N]
That is, for the commoners they are.[A]
[Right]
Getting a compliment out of you[N]
is like pulling teeth, huh?[N]
I guess we should be grateful.[AN]
[Left]
You should. It's harder to get Iberis[N]
to give a common man his dues than it is[N]
to take back Castle Freyse, I'd guess.[AN]
[Beat]Speaking of, that gives me an idea.[N]
If you're so fond of them, Iberis,[N]
why not stick with the Liberators?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Huh? Milord, I would much prefer[N]
re-entering your retinue, instead.[AN]
Putting aside their[Beat] unwashedness,[N]
what use could I possibly have[N]
serving the rebels instead of you?[AN]
[Right]
For once, I agree with Iberis.[N]
We've got no need for a noble who thinks[N]
she's our boss. You can keep her, [OpenQuote]milord."[A]
[Left]
But you need soldiers, don't you?[AN]
Iberis can handle herself in a fight,[N]
and I'd prefer to have someone I trust[N]
working closely with you Liberators.[AN]
[FarRight]
To monitor our actions, I presume?[AN]
I hardly think we're worthy[N]
of such distrust, Lord Korovai.[N]
We just saved your life, after all.[AN]
[Left]
Monitor's a nasty way of putting it,[N]
so maybe you're the one who doesn't[N]
trust me. But if it makes you feel better,[AN]
consider her presence[Beat] insurance,[N]
to make sure neither of us try to pull[N]
anything on the other party. Sound good?[AN]
[FarRight]
Well, I have nothing to hide from you,[N]
so I couldn't care less, either way.[N]
Iberis, what do you think of this?[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]If it pleases Lord Korovai, then[N]
I'll continue to follow your orders,[N]
loathe as I am to serve my lessers.[AN]
[Right]
Always with the high-and-mighty[N]
attitude[Beat] Well, you're not useless.[N]
I guess you can join the rank and file.[AN]

Good, everyone agrees. Hurray![A] Huzzah![AN]

There's no need to take the blame.[N]
I bet that even if you'd have told her[N]
to back down, she wouldn't have done it.[AN]
Always too eager to please me[Beat][N]
And look where it got her, in the end.[AN]
[Right]
W-What? How can you speak that way?[N]
Isn't she your cousin, your blood?[N]
Aren't you sad in the slightest?[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]It was her choice to put her life[N]
on the line, so what's the point?[AN]
The dead are dead. If you want to honor[N]
them, then think about what comes next[N]
and make sure they didn't die in vain.[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]It is as Lord Korovai says.[N]
Lady Iberis would be a proud martyr,[N]
so long as House Freyse is restored.[AN]

Well, beyond us wanting to help[N]
in the fight against Cythes,[AN]
we'd heard that House Freyse was[N]
in possession of a certain axe.[AN]
Supposedly, it's a legendary axe[N]
used in the past to great effect,[N]
along with other divine weapons.[AN]
Would you mind giving it to us,[N]
or at least telling us if it exists?[AN]
[Left]
Seriously? You're just here[N]
chasing some old wives' tales?[N]
You lot are dafter than I thought.[A]
[FarLeft]
Milord! You speak out of turn.[N]
The Liberators have gone through[N]
a great deal of effort to aid us.[AN]
Perhaps they deserve a reward.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Just spoke my mind, but here. The old man[N]
dug it out of the basement, right before[N]
they killed him. Take it, if you want.[A]
[Right]
This[Beat] This is the axe Kwame spoke of?[N]
No way! It's completely shattered.[N]
Barely even looks like a damn axe.[A]
[Left]
Why do you think I gave it to you?[N]
If it was worth anything, then I would[N]
have kept it. Next order of business,[AN]
how about you make yourselves useful?[N]
Follow me to Zykhra Gate if you[N]
really care about Decia's liberation.[AN]
I promise that it'll be a better use[N]

Please forgive His Lordship for his[N]

That said, you all did wonderful work[N]
today, and I know he agrees despite his[N]

[FarRight]
Of course. Our common foe is much[N]
more important than our differences,[AN]
and as long as you all are the best[N]
way for us to free Decia from Cythes's[N]
boot, then we'll continue aiding you.[A]
[Right]
Let me say it plainer. We're not here[N]
to lick House Freyse's boots, Epony;[.4][N]
we're here to get rid of our invaders.[AN]
If your lord's ego gets in the way,[N]
then we're gonna have to reconsider[N]
risking our comrades' lives for you.[A]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Worry not. Despite his grousing,[N]
Lord Korovai listens to my advice,[AN]
and you Liberators are important allies[N]
that neither of us can afford to lose.[AN]
I will ensure that he sees reason,[N]

[Beat]Wow, I might actually prefer Korovai.[N]
Still, what the hell is this axe?[AN]
Is Kwame pulling one over on us?[N]
There's no way this thing's real.[AN]
[MidRight]
Perhaps Kwame can enlighten us on[N]
the authenticity of the axe later,[AN]
or maybe the use of it goes beyond[N]
that which we can see ourselves[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox][LoadLoeweAngry]
We'd better hope so. We've fought[N]
someone else's battle, killed[N]
people who'd done no harm to us,[AN]
and all we got in return[N]
is belittlement and this junk![A]
[MidRight]
It's not a waste, Loewe. Even if they[N]
hadn't harmed us yet, there's no doubt[N]
that Cythes would have conscripted them.[AN]
And sympathizers to their cause would[N]
have had no issues taking up arms,[N]
striking us down without remorse.[AN]
Eventually, they'd be our enemies.[A]
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
Maybe you're right, Cleo, but killing[N]
Decians[Beat] It still doesn't sit well[N]
with me, even if we'd face them later.[AN]
And the silver lining? We get to follow[N]
an arrogant blueblood's orders, so that[N]
he can get back on his beloved throne.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Better him there than Cythes, right?[AN]
Even if this Lord Korovai is an ass,[N]
it doesn't mean he's not valuable to us.[AN]
