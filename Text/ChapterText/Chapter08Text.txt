Ch8: Zykhra Gate[X]

## GroupPlans
[Left][LoadKorovai]
[FarLeft][LoadEpony]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadLoewe]
[Right]
Hold, everyone.[AN]
There's a small fortress[N]
over the hill there.[AN]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Then we've arrived.[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Wait, this is Zykhra Gate?[AN]
Looks way too big to be[N]
one, if you ask me.[AN]
[FarLeft]
You're right, Loewe.[N]
This was a fortress, once.[AN]
It was used during the[N]
Reclamation Wars.[AN]
Zykhra was a major general[N]
during those battles.[AN]
[Left]
If we want to be able to[N]
free the rest of Freyse[AN]
from the empire, we'll need[N]
the gate to access those lands.[AN]
[Right]
Then we need to be on the[N]
top of our games.[AN]
We can't afford to[N]
fail here.[AN]
[Left]
We've already got two of[N]
our own on the prowl there.[AN]
We could perhaps arrange[N]
for them to aid you.[AN]
Look out for a pink-haired dragon[N]
rider and a blue-haired cavalier.[AN]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Let us hope they can prove[N]
their worth.[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
They've been handpicked[N]
for their proficiency.[AN]
I can assure you they will[N]
not falter.[AN]
[Right]
Then I look forward to meeting[N]
our new allies.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Don't bite it out[N]
there, Liberators.[AN]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Wait, what will you do, Korovai?[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
You've got things handled[N]
here, hopefully.[AN]
My troops and I will keep[N]
an eye out for any reinforcements[AN]
or stragglers from the previous[N]
battle.[AN]
It would not be convenient for any[N]
of us if you were to be blindsided.[AN]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
If you say so, Korovai.[AN]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
We'll be heading out.[N]
Don't bite it out there[N]
either, Korovai.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Don't worry, Cleo.[N]
I'll make sure he doesn't.[AN][X]

## HegeAndCidor
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
[MidRight][LoadCidor]
[MidLeft]
Lord Cidor![N]
What brings you here?[AN]
[MidRight]
Elias has tasked me with[N]
overseeing the forces in this area.[AN]
I see my reinforcements[N]
have served you well[AN]
in keeping the Freyse[N]
rebels at bay.[AN]
But I have reason to suspect[N]
they may have gotten aid.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Unfortunate, but very well.[N]
What should I look out for?[AN]
[MidRight]
The Decian Liberators.[AN]
I've tried to track them down,[N]
but I've lost them after[AN]
their general was killed and[N]
they fled,[AN]
with their last sighting being[N]
a port in the area.[AN]
There's no guarantee they're[N]
with them, it's just a hunch.[AN]
But do prepare, regardless.[N]
We can't lose this gate.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
As you wish, milord.[AN][X]

## CleoAndLoeweEndText
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidLeft]
We've taken the gate,[N]
yet their commander escaped[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
Your tone[Beat][N]
You knew her, didn't you?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah[Beat][AN]
Hege and I were old[N]
friends in bygone days.[AN]
But those times have[N]
long since passed.[AN]
[MidRight]
Cleo, do you think helping[N]
Korovai is the right thing?[AN]
I know we need the rebellion[N]
so we can all succeed,[AN]
but something about him[N]
rubs me the wrong way,[AN]
especially with what happened[N]
with those reinforcements.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Believe me, I've noticed.[AN]
But it's as you said, we can't[N]
just turn tail.[AN]
We both need each other's help,[AN]
and leaving would likely make us[N]
an enemy of his.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, you're right.[AN]
I just hope that Dragana's[N]
not disappointed[Beat][AN][X]

## LoeweConfrontsKorovai
[MidLeft][LoadKorovai]
[MidRight][LoadLoeweAngry]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Korovai.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Loewe? What in blazes[N]
are you-[AN]
[MidRight]
You were supposed to have[N]
our backs out there.[AN]
But we got ambushed by some[N]
patrolmen.[AN]
It's a miracle we managed to[N]
pull off that victory at all.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I am truly sorry about[N]
what happened, Loewe.[AN]
I fear that I have underestimated[N]
what Cythes is capable of.[AN]
I should have done a better[N]
job as your ally.[AN]
[MidRight]
You'd better be glad that our[N]
alliance is a necessity,[AN]
because my patience[N]
is running thin.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'll strive to do better[N]
in the future.[AN]
[MidRight]
I don't want words.[N]
I want action.[AN]
I'll be seeing you, Korovai.[AN][X]

## KorovaiAndEpony
[MidLeft][LoadEpony]
[MidRight][LoadKorovai]
[MidLeft]
Lord Korovai, what did[N]
you tell him?[AN]
[MidRight]
I told him that we[N]
underestimated Cythes.[AN]
He doesn't know we let the[N]
patrolmen through.[AN]
[MidLeft]
And it seems the test[N]
of perserverance was successful.[AN]
Now we know that they're truly[N]
capable of helping us save Freyse.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat][N]
I agree, Epony.[AN]
But now we need to focus our[N]
energy on Cythes and Freyse,[AN]
not the Liberators.[AN]
They're our only allies,[N]
and we can't afford to lose them.[AN]
No doubt that Loewe's already[N]
suspicious, and if they find out[AN]
what happened in the village[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
Don't worry, Korovai,[N]
they won't.[AN][X]

## HegeAndKwame
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
[MidRight][LoadKwame]
[MidLeft]
Heh, I knew I recognized[N]
you, my teacher.[AN]
I can't believe you're[N]
with this lot, Kwame.[AN]
[MidRight]
Your tactics were impressive,[N]
Hege.[AN]
But I have a mission and can't[N]
allow Cythes to get in the way.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Then, that axe[Beat][AN]
You're trying to beat[N]
Cythes with the Lost Ritual.[AN]
[MidRight]
H-How do you know of the[N]
contents of the Forbidden Passages?[AN]
Was it Cidor?[N]
Orfeas?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Maybe you'll learn one day.[AN]
But I've already said[N]
too much.[AN]
I cannot let myself fall[N]
into the hands of the enemy![AN][MoveMidLeft]
Ack![AN]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight]
A dagger[Beat][AN]
Took her own life to[N]
protect that info[Beat][AN]
What are you up to, Cythes?[AN][X]


## MifanAndCidor
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
[MidRight][LoadMifan]
[MidRight]
That armor[Beat][N]
You're Duke Cidor, yes?[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Who asks?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Relax, I mean no harm.[N]
In fact, I can help you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What does someone like you[N]
have to offer to Selese?[AN]
[MidRight]
You see, I've got some beef[N]
with those Liberators you're after.[AN]
They're in league with[N]
Freyse's rebellion now.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Just as I suspected[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
The heir's name is Korovai.[AN]
They seem to be heading north,[N]
towards your territory.[AN]
Prepare however you will.[AN]
[MidLeft]
While this all sounds[N]
promising,[AN]
I must know how you got[N]
this info.[AN]
[MidRight]
Lord Korovai treated us[N]
like mere rats,[AN]
cutting many of my allies[N]
down like wheat in a field.[AN]
He won't get away with this,[N]
no matter what.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That seems believable,[N]
but I need one more[N]
thing to prove yourself.[AN]
Join up with the Selese army.[N]
Worry not, I will make sure[N]
you're properly compensated.[AN]
[MidRight]
If it means avenging my comrades,[N]
then I will do what I must.[AN]
Thank you, Cidor.[AN][X]

## HegeWarning
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
Francis's patrol should[N]
be here soon[Beat][AN]
Probably about [ToggleRed]five minutes[ToggleRed][N]
or so.[AN]
Then the Liberators won't[N]
stand a chance![A][X]

## FrancisArrives
[MidLeft][LoadFrancis]
[MidRight][LoadSoldier]
[MidRight]
Commander, there seems[N]
to be a disturbance here.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Dang it[Beat][AN]
Well, we'd better intervene.[N]
Don't wanna get in trouble.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
As you say, Commander.[AN][X]

## CleoReactsToFrancis
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
Reinforcements?[AN]
They must have managed[N]
to overpower Korovai.[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadLoeweAngry]
Or perhaps he[N]
double-crossed us.[AN]
[MidRight]
Perhaps[Beat][AN]
But regardless, we[N]
need to finish things[AN]
here before we get[N]
overwhelmed ourselves.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Agreed.[AN][X]

## LoeweTobieTalkCh8Text
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][LoadTobie]
[MidLeft]
Hey, Tobie.[AN]
You're book smart,[N]
aren't you?[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Yeah. Why?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I wanted to see if[N]
you knew about Zykhra,[N]
the gate's namesake.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
General Zykhra?[N]
Yeah, he's pretty famous[AN]
to the people who live[N]
in these regions.[AN]
He was a master weaponsmith,[N]
setting many of the standards[AN]
that modern smiths use[N]
to this day.[AN]
[MidLeft]
It seems he was a big deal.[AN]
My father mostly had Mahemen history[N]
books, so I never learned[AN]
much about Cythean history[N]
until I met Dragana.[AN]
[MidRight]
I'm surprised you never[N]
learned about Zykhra.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah, I know.[AN]
Dragana never did much with[N]
the Reclamation Wars.[AN]
We mostly focused on recent[N]
history due to it being[AN]
more likely to be[N]
relevant to the Liberators.[AN]
[MidRight]
I see[Beat][AN]
Well, if you need any[N]
more info, I've got it covered.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Thank you, Tobie.[A][X]

## NoraCleoTalkCh8Text
[MidLeft][LoadNora]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hey, Cleo, you wouldn't[N]
happen to know a man[N]
named Boro, wouldn't you?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Boro[Beat][AN]
He was one of the people[N]
who founded the Liberators.[AN]
But now, his allegiance and[N]
fate are uncertain.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, I saw Boro a couple[N]
weeks back.[AN]
He's alive.[AN]
[MidRight]
What!? How did he[N]
survive Cidor's onslaught?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
He's undoubtedly a skilled[N]
combatant, but he was hurt[N]
pretty bad.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
What did Boro say[N]
about us?[AN]
[MidLeft]
He said he's done with[N]
freedom fighting,[AN]
and that you shouldn't[N]
try to find him.[AN]
I let him be after[N]
that.[AN]
[MidRight]
I see[Beat][AN]
Thank you for this[N]
info, Nora.[AN]
Regardless of what[N]
Boro's done,[AN]
I'm glad to hear that[N]
he's alive.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Think nothing of it,[N]
Cleo.[AN][X]


## HegeCleoBossQ
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
Well, the traitor's[N]
shown her face.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
Figures I'd see you[N]
here, Hege.[AN]
But I've chosen my path,[N]
and I will not back down.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
I will not falter, either.[N]
Have at you, Cleo![A][X]

## HegeBossQ
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
It seems you've gotten[N]
a second wind.[AN]
But the will of Cythes[N]
won't be eroded[AN]
by a wind such[N]
as yours![A][X]

## FrancisBossQ
[MidLeft][LoadFrancis]
Ah, you're the idiots[N]
causing this ruckus.[AN]
Just keel over and[N]
die, won't ya?[A][X]
