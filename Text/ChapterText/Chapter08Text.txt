## Chapter8Title
Ch8: Zykhra Gate[X]

## Ch8_WM_Text
Having gained a new ally in Lord Korovai,[AN]
the Liberators put aside their misgivings[N]
and look anxiously towards their next target:[AN][Event]
Zykhra Gate, a fortress with ancient roots,[N]
tracing back to the Reclamation Wars.[AN]
Over Decia's many years, countless conflicts[N]
have raged over possession of this position,[AN]
the last bastion of resistance before reaching[N]
Castle Freyse, south Decia's center of power.[AN][Event]
The hopes of countless soldiers have died within[N]
Zykhra's walls. [OpenQuote]Will we fare any better?"[AN][Event]
Cleo and Loewe cannot avoid this question,[N]
as they take a brief rest from the march...[A][X]

[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[Right]
You wanna try repeating that, Kwame?[N]
I'm not sure I heard you right.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
No matter how many times I repeat[N]
myself, the truth remains, Loewe.[AN]
This axe is the [OpenQuote]Worldcleaver",[N]
a member of the four divine weapons[N]
that felled Abalone IX in ancient times.[AN]
As Havarti tells it, the axe could[N]
even reshape the earth at the will[N]
of its wielder, the mighty warrior Danu.[AN]
Perhaps his bloodline formed what[N]
we now know as House Freyse[Beat][N]
Though, this is simply conjecture.[AN]
[Right]
That axe can barely crack a pebble.[N]
Are all your fancy stories made-up,[N]
or are these weapons useless to us?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Neither. I admit, I too expected it[N]
to be in better shape than this,[AN]
but the traces of Byelen's power[N]
still reverberate through its blade,[N]
and so, it will serve our needs.[AN]
[FarRight]
[Beat]If not to use it like a weapon,[N]
then what is its purpose, Sir Kwame?[N]
I hoped I could use it myself, but[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha! Now that would have been a sight.[N]
As for its purpose, it has none to us[N]
until the other weapons are gathered.[AN]
There is a way to restore the power[N]
they once held, but it requires us[N]
to acquire the source of said power.[AN]
Each weapon has one, and it is possible[N]
that each weapon has lost its source,[N]
just as the Worldcleaver clearly has.[AN]
[FarRight]
I thought the source of their magic[N]
was Byelen Himself. Is there some[N]
other mechanism that we're unaware of?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Yes, I suppose there is, Lady Cleo.[AN]
That is, a reason the weapons never[N]
ravaged the world, centuries after[N]
their original owners had passed.[AN]
Their true might is shackled to the[N]
people that once wielded them[Beat][AN]
And if you intend to break those[N]
chains, it requires finding their[N]
bearers and breaking that link.[A]
[Right]
Well, that explains why Korovai's[N]
old man couldn't use the axe.[AN]
[Beat]Wait, you're saying we have to go[N]
grave robbing to use the damn things?[N]
How do we even find their owners?[A]
[MidLeft]
Once we gather all four of the weapons,[N]
finding those who have bonded to them[N]
should be an easy task to accomplish.[AN]
[Right]
And yet, you're not telling us[N]
how to actually do that, are you?[N]
Too afraid we'd do it ourselves?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No, not at all. This knowledge[N]
is something you cannot find,[N]
something even I do not know.[AN]
But with all four of the weapons[N]
in our possession, we could divine[N]
the locations of whom we seek.[AN]
[FarRight]
And until we do that, the weapons[N]
serve no purpose to us, is that it?[AN]
In that case, we can't prioritize[N]
searching for them, Sir Kwame.[N]
We have more pressing concerns.[A]
[MidLeft]
A wise decision, Lady Cleo. For now,[N]
the liberation of Decia is paramount[N]
and something I desire as much as you.[AN]
Allow me to handle tracking down the[N]
weapons while you focus on the battles[N]
ahead, and I will not disappoint you.[AN]
[Right]
Hmph, I don't need any motivation to[N]
focus on knocking Cythes down a peg.[AN]
[Beat]Speaking of, they should be here.[N]
Can't those two bluebloods be on ti-[A]
[FarFarRight][LoadKorovai]
It's time for the operation,[N]
Liberators. Let me in.[N]
We've got info to share.[A][X]

[FarRight][LoadKorovai]
[Left]
Lord Korovai? I admit, I would much[N]
prefer if you asked before entering.[AN]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Our apologies, Cleo, but taking[N]
Zykhra Gate must be done promptly.[AN]
Our scouts have managed to find an[N]
entry into its walls, so we rushed[N]
here to inform you of this news.[AN]
[FarRight]
Right. Zykhra Gate's the last haven[N]
of Cythean dogs til Castle Freyse.[AN]
Taking it for ourselves is necessary,[N]
and that's where you all come in.[N]
That is, if you've got the stones.[AN]
[FarLeft]
I've never run away from a fight with[N]
Cythes, and I'm not starting today.[AN]
But from the sounds of it, you're not[N]
helping us. What's the idea there?[N]
Do you want the fort taken or not?[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]I hate to admit this, but you've[N]
all seen our forces for yourselves.[N]
Or rather, our lack thereof.[AN]
Until we can rally more soldiers[N]
to our banner, you all are much[N]
more likely to succeed here.[AN]
And to ensure that you can do so,[N]
someone has to protect the camp[N]
from any pincer attacks, yes?[AN]
[Left]
I suppose there are a few Cythean[N]
garrisons in the area that could[N]
catch us off guard otherwise, yes.[AN]
The logic here is sound, Loewe.[N]
Besides, I'd prefer to operate without[N]
their interference[Beat] Er, no offense.[AN]
[FarRight]
Good enough, so long as that's a yes.[AN]
Anyway, we ordered the scouts to link[N]
up with you, so be on the lookout.[N]
Their names are[Beat] uh, Epony?[AN]
[Right]
Nora and Hans. Fine soldiers with[N]
finer steeds[Beat] Feel free to make[N]
use of them, even after this battle.[AN]
You'll have more need of them than us.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Not sure I like the sound of that,[N]
but hey, we'll take what we can get.[N]
So, is that it, Your Lordship?[AN]
[FarRight]
Ha! I'll let the attitude slide,[N]
this once[Beat] Don't get killed out there,[N]
Loewe. Or do. Makes no difference to me.[AN][CSSCF]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Believe it or not, I think[N]
he's beginning to warm up to you.[A]
[FarLeft]
I'd hate to see how he talks[N]
to his enemies, if that's true.[AN]
[Right]
Heh, I suppose you would. Regardless,[N]
good luck to you both, Cleo, Loewe.[AN]
Leave guarding your flank to us![A][X]

[MidLeft]
Yeah, Zykhra Gate.[N]
What's so strange about it?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, was I speaking out loud?[AN]
It's nothing. Just, well[Beat][N]
A former friend of mine commanded[N]
the Cythean forces that reside here.[AN]
I'd almost forgotten, with everything,[N]
but[Beat] I wonder if she's still here.[AN]
[MidLeft]
If she is, then she's the enemy.[N]
Someone that we can't let run free.[N]
Isn't that what you said, Cleo?[A]
[MidRight]
I[Beat] No, you're right, Loewe.[N]
I made my choice, and she made hers.[N]
There's nothing more to say, is there?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Right. Anyway, let's get moving.[N]
Those scouts must be waiting on us[Beat][N]
Let's see how useful they really are.[AN][X]

I'm Nora. At your service![AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Hans.[AN]
[Right]
Pleased to meet you both. Tell me,[N]
what's the situation here?[AN]
[Left]
They saw us coming and rallied[N]
every soldier in the fort to arms.[AN]
Apologies, but they're quite ready.[N]
We won't have the element of surprise.[AN]
[FarRight]
It's fine; we don't need it.[N]
Anything we need to watch out for?[AN]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]They're well-fortified, yeah.[AN]
Heard about a ballista somewhere,[N]
and there are other long-range[N]
weapons that they've got ready.[AN]
Lots of indoor areas that'll stop[N]
all of us from using our mounts,[N]
so yeah, we're gonna have a great time.[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]You're a ray of sunshine, huh?[AN]
Chin up, Hans. We can handle it,[N]
just like we've handled everything else.[AN]
[Left]
Oh, don't worry about him.[N]
He's always moping, really.[AN]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Better than pretending everything's[N]
fine, like you do. Or maybe you just don't[N]
know how screwed we all are. Is that it?[A]
[Left]
Hans, really? Right in front of our[N]
new captains, you're doing this?[N]
Do you know how bad you're making us-[A]
[Right]
Nora, that's enough. I appreciate your[N]
concern and Hans's honesty, but let's[N]
focus on winning the battles ahead.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Since you'll both be in our company[N]
for a while, let's all get along[N]
and do our best to liberate Freyse![A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Sounds good to me, Captain Cleo![N]
I think we'll get along just fine.[AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
I don't have any other choice, so[Beat][N]
Just don't get me killed, boss.[AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Wasn't really planning on it, Hans.[N]
[Beat]Looks like the room in the back[N]
is where your old buddy is, Cleo.[AN]
You ready to get the job done?[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]Of course. Let's make use of the paths[N]
to snake around the buildings,[AN]
leaving the indoor areas to those[N]
who are better suited to it than us.[N]
[Beat]Be on your guard, everyone.[AN]
This is our most important battle yet![A][X]


## Ch8HegeIntro
[MidLeft][LoadHege][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]These are the Liberators that[N]
Captain Johanna mentioned before?[AN]
She said that they didn't operate[N]
in Freyse, but here they are.[N]
I'd better send word to her, fast.[AN]
[Beat]If they break through my forces,[N]
then Castle Freyse is probably their[N]
next target. And if that's the case,[AN]
then I'll send a message to Duke Cidor[N]
to see if he can provide reinforcements.[AN]
[Beat]Hey, I should look on the bright side.[N]
Now, I can finally confirm whether[N]
the rumors whirling around are true.[AN]
Cleo[Beat] Did you really betray us?[N]
Did our time together and our oaths[N]
mean nothing? [Beat]Time to find out.[AN][X]

[MidLeft][LoadHege]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
It's done. I thought Hans was just[N]
exaggerating, but you really were[N]
prepared for us, weren't you?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat][AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Your name was Hege, yeah?[AN]
I don't appreciate the silence,[N]
so you'd better start talking.[N]
Otherwise, my bowstring might slip.[AN]
[Right]
Loewe, she's defeated and unarmed.[N]
There's no need to threaten her,[N]
is there? Let's all just talk.[AN]
[MidLeft]
And what should I say to a traitor[N]
who's working against the empire?[AN]
If you want me to help you out,[N]
then save yourselves some time[N]
and kill me. I'm not talking.[AN]
[FarRight]
[Beat]You heard her, Cleo. If she's not[N]
gonna cooperate, then we should put[N]
her down before she makes us regret it.[AN]
[Right]
Loewe, I don't want to repeat myself.[N]
She's no danger to us right now,[N]
so settle down and let me talk to her.[AN]
[FarRight][LoadLoeweAngry]
You didn't give the people in Shagahn[N]
that same mercy, did you? Tell me, Cleo.[N]
Is it different if they're an old pal?[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
That was-[AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
You said that if someone might threaten[N]
us later, it'd be stupid to leave them[N]
alive, even if they're not a threat now.[AN]
Now's the time to practice what you[N]
preach, unless you've got a real good[N]
reason. Why should I let Hege live?[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]Do you mind hearing a bit[N]
of our history, Loewe? I think[N]
that it could help you see why.[AN]
[FarRight]
[Beat]Why not? Better make it quick, though.[N]
Otherwise, Korovai and Epony'll show up,[N]
and they won't be as kind as I am.[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]We both went to the Gechrysos[N]
Military Academy to become officers,[N]
to serve our country with pride.[AN]
She was something of a mentor to me,[N]
having joined a year before I did,[AN]
but more than that, she was[Beat][N]
My truest friend during my time there.[AN]
Everyone else had some kind of angle.[N]
Some despised me due to my family name,[N]
while others vied for my favor instead.[AN]
Hege[Beat] She had no hidden motives.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]My village pooled together money[N]
so that I could have a better life[N]
as an officer in the Cythean military.[AN]
Because of that, I focused on making[N]
them proud, not trying to get in good[N]
with a rich girl. Looking back now,[AN]
you were pretty similar, Cleo.[N]
Driven, despite how much you had.[N]
I respected you[Beat] But I was wrong.[AN]
In the end, you could never understand[N]
how us poor northerners suffered,[N]
with smaller and smaller harvests.[AN]
You cared more about your own feelings[N]
than the people starving back home.[AN]
One day, it'd be my family starving[Beat][N]
That's why I never betrayed Cythes,[N]
like you. I've got more at stake.[AN]
[FarRight][LoadLoeweAngry]
Excuse me if your little sob story[N]
doesn't strike a chord, Hege. Maybe[N]
you've been too cooped up here to see,[AN]
but Cythes has torn apart too many[N]
Decian families to count. My mother[Beat][AN]
my father[Beat] Both died ten years ago,[N]
at the hands of soldiers like you.[AN]
Bastards who would follow any order,[N]
so long as the people they cared[N]
about were happy and healthy.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Would you do any differently,[N]
if you were standing in my shoes?[AN]
If it was your mother struggling[N]
to make ends meet, if taking from[N]
others could put food on the table[Beat][AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox][LoadLoewe]
[Beat][A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Hege, it isn't a lack of empathy[N]
for the less fortunate that made me[N]
switch sides. In fact, it's the opposite.[AN]
I saw the pain and suffering that people[N]
like us were perpetrating[Beat] People that[N]
I trusted, burning villages to the ground.[AN]
Children crying out for their mothers[Beat][N]
In the face of that, how could I keep[N]
pretending that our crimes were justified?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Pretty words, as always, Cleo.[N]
Is that how you two gathered so many[N]
people? Almost got me to switch teams.[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]It's not too late to change, Hege.[N]
We can stand side-by-side, once again,[N]
if you're willing to take my hand.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]I can't. Even if I agreed with you,[N]
my family's not rich or powerful enough[N]
to avoid the fallout. Not like yours is.[AN]
[Right]
I understand, but if you have any shred[N]
of conscience in your heart, then at least[N]
stop supporting this madness in Decia.[AN]
I can arrange for it to look as if you[N]
died so that no harm comes to your family.[N]
As for me... Once Decia is liberated,[N]
I mean to find a path forward for Cythes[N]
where we don't have to sacrifice anyone.[AN]
Please, Hege. Just give me some time.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Fine, Cleo. You win, like usual.[AN]
I still don't think that what I've done[N]
was wrong. I only wanted to make sure[N]
my little siblings could grow up[Beat][AN]
But if there's some other way to save[N]
Cythes than this, I'm willing to let[N]
you find it, Cleo. If anyone can,[AN]
it's you[Beat] Don't die out there.[A][X]

If she goes back on her word,[N]
then I'll let the arrow fly[N]
next time, no matter what you say.[AN]
[MidRight]
And I'll let you, Loewe, but Hege[N]
is, if nothing else, quite honest.[AN]
So honest that she could never win[N]
when all of us recruits would play[N]
cards[Beat] I miss those days, now.[AN]
Everyone there, despite their faults,[N]
seemed to genuinely want the best[N]
for the world[Beat] How easily we fell.[AN]

She was so good a soldier that maybe,[N]
the thought never even occurred to her.[AN]

Look, I don't know all the details,[N]
but you've got plenty of talent, Cleo.[N]
You're being too hard on yourself.[AN]
[MidRight]
It's kind of you to say that,[N]
but I only speak the truth.[AN]
[Beat]Regardless, my letters with Hege[N]
during our deployment kept me sane,[N]
before I eventually deserted.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Sounds to me like they kept you crazy,[N]
instead. You were right to feel stressed,[N]
given everything that Cythes had you do.[AN]
[Beat]No matter how good of a soldier Hege[N]
was, she lacked that same soul, Cleo.[AN]
If she did have it, maybe she'd be[N]

There're some villages along the way[N]
that'll make for a nice place to raise[N]
ourselves a little militia. Right, Epony?[AN]

Mm. I intend to spread our victory here[N]
far and wide, so old Freysian nobles[N]

Now, I must finally rid Decia of her[N]

[MidRight][LoadTiberius]
U-Uncle! I apologize for barging in,[N]
but a messenger just arrived from[N]
Zykhra Gate. With dire news, I fear.[AN]
The captain of Zykhra Gate reported[N]
that the Liberators resurfaced there,[N]
with more numbers than they had before.[AN]
[Beat]The gate's already fallen, Uncle.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Truly? I never expected they would move[N]
so quickly after Dragana's passing[Beat][N]
But they will not go any further.[AN]
I've some soldiers in mind to send as[N]
reinforcements, so ready them, Tiberius.[N]
Otherwise, Castle Freyse may fall next.[AN]
[MidRight]
Certainly, I can do that, but Uncle,[AN]
aren't General Elias and his soldiers[N]
en route already? A knight in the Order[N]
of the Iris shouldn't need our help,[AN]
not in a matter so small. Am I wrong?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yes. It's not about [OpenQuote]need", boy.[N]
If we refuse to help him settle it,[N]
then what use does Cythes have for us?[AN]
That question is one neither of us wants[N]
Emperor Orfeas to ask himself, now is it?[AN]
So, we must do our part to eradicate[N]
these Liberators, once and for all.[AN]
Hmm[Beat] Tiberius, it's time. I'm leaving[N]
you in charge of House Selese's defenses[N]
so that I can support our soldiers myself.[AN]

I'm not[Beat] I'm not ready to take[N]
your place, Uncle. Not by a long shot.[N]
And what if you fall in battle?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Oh? Worried about me, Tiberius?[AN]
Your concerns are welcome, but misplaced.[N]
In fact, I used to be quite the warrior[N]
in my youth, if you can believe it.[AN]
And even though I'm past my prime,[N]
you should know well enough how[N]
strong I still am, from our spars.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ha, I suppose I can't deny that, can I?[AN]
[Beat]I always wondered: with your power,[N]
and with the tales I heard of my father,[N]
could we not have fought against Cythes?[AN][MidLeft][ToggleSmile][MidRight]
My mother said that the two of you used[N]
to beat back Cythean patrols yourselves,[N]
before they invaded us in earnest.[AN]
[Beat]What changed, Uncle? Why give in?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]A lord's duty is not just to rule.[AN]
It is to protect those beneath them,[N]
to take on the same challenges that[N]
they would give to their subjects.[AN]
[Beat]And trying to stop Cythes's invasion,[AN]
once they resolved to subordinate us,[N]
would have threatened complete and utter[N]
annihilation of all that we held dear.[AN]
[Beat]Does that answer your question?[AN]
[MidRight]
I[Beat] Yes, Uncle. I understand now.[N]
Just[Beat] please, stay safe, alright?[N]
Selese[Beat] No, I still need you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Worry not, Tiberius. My safety[N]
is assured, so focus on your duties here[N]
instead of fearing for me. Understand?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Yes, Uncle.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Good[Beat] I'm relying on you, my boy.[N]
If you cannot believe in yourself,[N]
then believe in the faith I have in you.[AN]
Now, I'm off. Take care, Tiberius.[A][CSSCF]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Uncle believes in me? Truly?[N]
Then I suppose I can't let him down.[N]
O Byelen, grant him a safe return[Beat][A][X]


## HegeEmilBossQ
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
Wait, I remember that face[Beat][N]
You deserted, didn't you?[AN]
Here I thought you'd run home,[N]
but you're a Liberator now?[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadEmil]
Got that right. One of them[N]
saved me from your goons,[AN]
and my ma raised me to help[N]
out anybody who helps me.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
What a simplistic creed.[N]
What would your mother think,[AN]
knowing that you've joined a[N]
group that threatens Cythes?[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadEmil]
Threatens? The way I see it,[N]
y'all are the only threats.[AN]
The people in Decia didn't[N]
do a thing to any of us.[AN]
Takin' their lands, their[N]
lives[Beat] Why? Why do it?[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
[Beat]The top brass has their[N]
reasons. Questioning them?[AN]
That's not either of our[N]
responsibilities, Emil.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadEmil]
Nah, I'm done takin' orders[N]
and not thinkin' about 'em.[AN]
If my family finds out that[N]
I deserted, it doesn't matter.[AN]
I'll tell 'em why I did it,[AN]
once I come back home as a[N]
man they can be proud of![A][X]

## HegeVargaBossQ
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
Hm? You're Cleo's teacher,[N]
correct? Why are you here?[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadVarga]
Should be obvious.[N]
Cleo's here, so I'm here.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
That isn't exactly what I mean,[N]
and I think you know that.[AN]
What would possess a former[N]
soldier, decorated as you are,[AN]
to betray the country that you[N]
served by becoming a rebel?[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadVarga]
You weren't even born when[N]
I got those medals, whelp.[AN]
You think you can speak?[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
From one soldier to another,[N]
yes. I think I've earned it.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadVarga]
You're nowhere near what[N]
I was when I retired, Hege.[AN]
[Beat]But fine, I'll tell you.[AN]
I left service in the first[N]
place because I lost someone.[AN]
Someone that I needed to keep[N]
safe[Beat] But I failed him.[AN]
[Beat]I refuse to do it again.[N]
That's the only reason I need![A][X]

## HegeCleoBossQ
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
I'd heard reports of someone[N]
who matched your description,[AN]
but I hoped that they were[N]
false. Of everyone deployed,[AN]
I thought that you, alone,[AN]
would never turn your back[N]
on your country[Beat] On us.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[Beat]I haven't turned my back[N]
on anything or anyone, Hege.[AN]
Perhaps you've forgotten,[N]
cozied up in this fortress,[AN]
but the excuses we were fed[N]
are unfounded in reality.[AN]
There is no benevolence[N]
in Cythes's actions, Hege.[AN]
Any Decian citizen unwilling[N]
to bend the knee pays for it,[AN]
and those who acquiesce lose[N]
rights to their livelihoods.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
The lands that we've seized[N]
belonged to us in the past,[AN]
Cleo. If people die because[N]
they won't let us take them,[AN]
it's[Beat] a necessary price.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadCleoAngry]
Necessary? How can you-[A][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
[Beat]If it's Decia's people[N]
or ours, the choice is clear.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadCleoAngry]
I refuse to make that choice![AN]
I refuse to allow the emperor[N]
to sacrifice the innocent.[AN]
[Beat]And if you mean to follow[N]
him to the grave, so be it![A][X]

## HegeHansBossQ
[MidRight][LoadHans]
[Beat]So, you're the last enemy.[AN]
It'd be just my luck to die[N]
when you're all that's left[Beat][AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
Uh[Beat] As far as I can tell,[N]
you're no one important.[AN]
If you don't want to fight,[N]
then you can just back down.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadHans]
No one important, huh[Beat][N]
Well, you're not wrong.[AN]
But even a knight like me[N]
has a shred of pride[Beat][AN]
I've survived all this way[Beat][N]
Time for one last gamble![A][X]

## HegeNoraBossQ
[MidRight][LoadNora]
You're the captain of this[N]
squadron, then? Excellent![AN]
Your fortifications were[N]
impressive, I must admit.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
Er, thanks? I wasn't expecting[N]
any compliments from you all.[AN]
We are, you know, enemies?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadNora]
And that's why I, more than[N]
anyone, can congratulate you;[AN]
I had to fight through them![AN]
[Beat]Regardless, the battle[N]
will soon come to a close.[AN]
It is almost a shame for our[N]
dance to end so soon[Beat][AN]
But if it must, then let us end[N]
it with the aplomb it deserves![A][X]

## HegeBossQ
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
So, you made it past our[N]
fortifications[Beat] Not bad.[AN]
I've heard tales of you[N]
Liberators from Duke Cidor,[AN]
but I never expected that you[N]
could get as far as you have.[AN]
[Beat]Still, there's a reason[N]
that I'm the captain here.[AN]
So long as I'm breathing,[N]
you won't take another step![A][X]

## HegeDeathQuote
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
Ngh[Beat] Well fought, Liberators.[N]
Take Zykhra Gate[Beat] You've[Beat][A][CloseEyes][X]

## HegeCaptureQuote
[MidLeft][LoadHege]
Ngh[Beat] Well fought, Liberators.[N]
[Beat]You're not killing me, then?[AN]
Thanks, I guess, but don't[N]
expect me to sell out Cythes.[AN]
I'm no traitor, unlike some.[A][X]
