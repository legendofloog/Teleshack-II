Ch9: Reap What You Sow[X]

## Ch9_WM_Text
With Zykhra Gate flying Decian colors[N]
once again, the Liberators breathe easy.[AN]
They take respite, slowing their march[N]
on the long path to Castle Freyse.[AN]
Meanwhile, Lord Korovai and Epony[N]
search for eager and fresh recruits,[AN]
seeking to raise an army that can[N]
recapture Korovai's former home.[AN]
In this quest, however, they find[N]
that some may not be so willing...[A][Event][X]

[Beat]Damn! Just take your gold, Kwame.[N]
My hand's terrible. Say, you shuffled[N]
the deck[Beat] Pulling any funny business?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Of course not, Loewe. I hardly need[N]
tricks to defeat you in a game of wits.[AN]
[Right]
Hmph. Well, I can't really deny that.[N]
[Beat]Hey, Cleo. Any sign of Korovai, yet?[N]
He and Epony should already be here.[AN]
[FarRight]
None yet. Perhaps their search for[N]
volunteers in the fight against[N]
Cythes has gone especially well?[AN]
[Right]
Ha! I think we both know that isn't it.[N]
A week trudging through these woods,[N]
and what's there to show for it?[AN]
A couple more soldiers in Freysian colors,[N]
sure, but none of them look like they've[N]
fought anything besides a couple trees.[AN]
[FarRight]
They may not be our ideal allies,[N]
but they could be the difference[N]
between life and death, Loewe.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Indeed, Lady Cleo speaks sagely.[N]
For now, let us continue to wait[N]
for Lord Korovai and Lady Epony.[AN]
[Beat]Ah, I did have one piece of news[N]
to share with you, about the relics.[AN]
[Right]
That was lower on your priority list[N]
then fleecing me for a hundred gold?[N]
[Beat]Well, let's hear it, Kwame.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Nothing major, but[Beat] One of the spies[N]
in my employ sent word to me, recently.[AN]
As it happens, the legendary bow,[N]
Daybreak, is quite close to us now[Beat][AN]
It is somewhere in Decia, supposedly,[N]
though we know not the exact location.[AN]
[Right]
That so? Well, get them working harder.[N]
I'm not searching a whole country for [N]
a single bow, no matter how magical it is.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Of course, of course. Your donation[N]
today will help a great deal, Loewe.[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]I'm gonna get you back, Kwame.[N]
Just wait for it, and you'll see.[AN]
[FarRight]
Regardless, thank you for continuing[N]
the search, Sir Kwame[Beat] Say, Loewe.[N]
You've lost enough today, haven't you?[AN]
Mind taking watch and letting me have[N]
a round against Kwame? After all,[N]
I might actually win for a change.[AN]
[Right]
Damn, can't catch a break[Beat][N]
Fine, do what you want.[N]
I'll be back in a bit.[A][X]

[Beat]No good. This settlement's barely[N]
standing, just like the others, huh?[N]
You think Cythes did this, Epony?[AN]
[FarRight]
Perhaps, or common bandits.[N]
I see a civilian over there[Beat][N]
Why not ask them, Lord Korovai?[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]Right.[A]

[Right]
 Hey, you there![N]
I need answers.[N]
What happened here?[A]
[Left]
[Beat]Who're you s'pose t' be?[AN]
[Right]
Lord Korovai, of House Freyse.[N]
My retinue and I intend to march[N]
on Castle Freyse to defeat Cythes.[AN]
[Left]
Hmph[Beat] Shoulda come here a week[N]
ago, lord. Too late now. Too late[Beat][AN]

Too late for what, man?[N]

Shut yer trap, er...[N]
What's yer name again?[AN]

T-Tomas, sir![A]
[FarLeft]
Right, right. Well, don't worry[N]
yer little heart, Tomas. Got it?[N]
I know exactly who I'm lookin' at.[AN]
[MidRight]
And I know who I'm looking at:[N]
pigs dyed in Cythean reds that were[N]
greedy enough to go after my people.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Gwahahaha! After what y'all did[N]
in Shagahn, ya got some nerve[N]
sayin' that, little lord.[AN]
[MidRight]
That was[Beat] That was different.[N]
Either way, get out of my way,[N]
or your head's going on my pike![AN]

then lemme show ya how wrong ya are![A][X]

What the hell did he-[AN]
[Left]
Nothin', but he'll be useful.[N]
You there! Bring Tomas's body back[N]
to the little militia we're brewin'.[AN]
Tell 'em Lord Korovai's comin'[N]
to butcher the lot of them,[N]

What? Too shocked to keep yappin'?[AN]
Ya called us the pigs earlier,[N]
but the one's happy to eat up slop[N]
are the villagers ya love so much.[AN]
The moment they hear about this[N]
and see poor, sad Tomas, trust me:[N]
they'll start frothin' at the mouth.[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]You're a dead man, Wrathgar.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh yeah? Give it your best shot,[N]
lordling. One thing, though:[N]
Better not take too long.[AN]
B'fore ya showed up, I sent word[N]
to a little bird in the sky.[N]
Might know him? The name's Elias.[AN]
[FarRight]
General Elias? Do you truly think[N]
that we would believe such obvious-[AN]
[MidLeft]
Believe whatever you want, lady.[N]
I've got a militia to raise,[N]
so have fun waitin' to die![A][X]

Lord Korovai, now is not the time[N]
to try chasing Wrathgar with this[N]
small a force. We need to pull back![AN]
[Right]
But[Beat] Epony, we can't just-[AN]
[FarRight]
Do you doubt my counsel?[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]Fine, I get it. If that's what you[N]
want, let's leave it to the Liberators.[AN][X]

[FarLeft][LoadLoewe]
[Left][LoadCleo]
[Right][LoadKorovai]
[FarRight][LoadEpony]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I took a look like you asked, Cleo.[AN]
And yeah, seems like this Wrathgar guy[N]
isn't lying. We've got enemy dracoknights[N]
on our flank, and they won't take long.[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]And there's no chance that we can[N]
convince the militia to stand down?[AN]
[FarRight]
The militiamen know[Beat] or rather,[N]
they believe us responsible for the[N]
tragic deaths back in Shagahn.[AN]
The corpse that Wrathgar brought back[N]
and blamed us for likely only adds[N]
to their certainty of our guilt.[AN]
At this point, nothing we say could[N]
change their minds. Of that, I am sure.[AN]
[Right]
Then if we want to escape these woods,[N]
we have no choice but to cut through them.[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]Right. The other end of the clearing[N]
should give enough cover to hide from[N]
Elias, giving us a chance to break away.[AN]
[Right]
Mm. And I'll be right there with you.[N]
Just gotta do some stretches, and-[N]
Ngh! Sorry, I just[Beat] Give me a second.[AN]
[FarRight]
Your wounds from Shagahn still[N]
need to heal, Lord Korovai.[N]
Please, leave this to the Liberators.[AN]
[FarLeft]
I agree. If you trot out there while[N]
you're injured, you won't do a damn[N]
thing but hold us back, Korovai.[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]Fine. If that's how it is, then[N]
I'll leave this up to you two.[N]
Thanks, and[Beat] sorry for this.[A][CSSCF]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]If that guy's apologizing,[N]
he must really be in bad shape.[N]
Guess we're on our own, Cleo.[AN]
[Left]
Maybe so, but we're well-acquainted[N]
with retreating, wouldn't you say?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Too acquainted[Beat] I'm about tired[N]
of this, Cleo. Ever since we joined[N]
up with Korovai back in Shagahn,[AN]
we keep making new enemies out[N]
of countrymen. It's not right.[AN]
[Left]
I agree, but now isn't the time for[N]
sympathy. If we want to survive today,[N]
we can't afford to show any mercy.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Some of the people over there can[N]
barely hold their spears, though.[N]
You want us to slaughter them?[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]If they mean to do the same to us,[N]
then yes. Any who surrender or defect[N]
are welcome, but as for anyone else[Beat][AN]
They know what they signed up for,[N]
taking up weapons against us.[N]
[Beat]Focus up, Loewe. It's time.[A][CSSCF]
[FarLeft]
Ha[Beat] Do they, though?[N]
Sometimes, I don't even know[N]
what I signed up for, anymore[Beat][A][X]

familiar. Heavy wings, beating[Beat][N]
Elias, are you[Beat] are you really here?[A][X]

## Ch9EliasArrives
[MidLeft][LoadElias][ThreeLineBox]
Man[Beat] Even with wings, this forest[N]
is hell to navigate. That distress[N]
signal had better be worth my time.[AN]
Couldn't even bring my whole platoon,[N]
but if duty calls, I have to answer[Beat][AN]

looks just like[Beat] Cleo? If it really[N]

if he catches up. We have to hurry![AN]

I'll try to get the others moving[N]
double time, but push comes to shove?[N]
I'll shoot him down if I have to![A][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadCleoSad]

[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Huff[Beat] Huff[Beat] Damn, so much for[N]
a break, huh? Cleo, did that Elias[N]
guy finally give up on chasing us?[AN]
[MidRight]
Not exactly easy to tell with these[N]
trees in the way, but if we can't[N]
see him, then he can't see us.[AN]
And Elias has never been the type[N]
to keep chasing when he can't see[N]
his prize, so we should be safe.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What, you two know each other from[N]
your fancy school or something?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Something like that, yes.[AN]
Regardless, those militia[Beat][N]
What a tragic end for them,[N]
falling for Wrathgar's words.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[OpenQuote]Falling"? Yeah, he stretched[N]
the truth, but in all those lies,[N]
a seed of it remained, didn't it?[AN]
We killed Decians back in Shagahn,[N]
and it came back to bite us.[AN]
Now, we've got even more Decian deaths[N]
on our conscience[Beat] I've had it, Cleo.[N]
Korovai's gonna get a piece of my mind.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I won't stop you, Loewe, but let me[N]
speak to Korovai before you go after him.[N]
He and Epony should be just ahead.[A][X]

[FarRight][LoadLoewe]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, our heroes show themselves![N]
To what do we owe the pleasure?[AN]
[Right]
Well, to start with, let me say that[N]
I'm glad that you two are unharmed.[AN]
With the[Beat] fervor of the enemy militia,[N]
there was a real possibility that they[N]
would ignore us and focus on you.[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]Nothing we couldn't handle,[N]
if they did. Still, thanks.[AN]
[Right]
But given the circumstances,[N]
I find it difficult to be positive[N]
about anything else. Our enemies[Beat][AN]
Certainly, some were Cytheans.[N]
But just as many were your countrymen:[N]
Decians who felt betrayed, Lord Korovai.[AN]
[Left]
Get to your point.[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]My point is that we cannot afford[N]
to create more enemies than we have,[N]
or we'll have no allies left, milord.[AN]
[Left]
Noted. Now, is that it?[AN]
We were waiting on you,[N]
and I'd rather not sit[N]
around here any longer.[AN]
[FarRight][LoadLoeweAngry]
[Beat][OpenQuote]Is that it"?[AN]
[Left]
Hm?[AN]
[FarRight]
You watched as our own damn people[N]
got hoodwinked by Cythean soldiers,[N]
and that's all you have to say?![AN]
[FarLeft]
Now, Loewe, we need not yell-[AN]
[FarRight]
We've bailed you two out, again[N]
and again, and somehow, you still[N]
think you're in charge, here?[AN]
Well, let me make things clear.[N]
If anything like this happens again,[N]
you're on your own. Understand?[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat] [Beat][A]
[Left]
[Beat]Yeah, I hear you loud and clear.[N]
It's not like we want that, either,[N]
but if push comes to shove, then-[AN]
[FarRight]
You can find as many reasons as you want,[N]
but I[Beat] no, we won't support oppression,[N]
no matter whose banner it's done under.[AN][LoadLoewe]
[Beat]Now, if you wanna get going, then[N]
be my guest. Let's not keep them, Cleo.[A][CSSCF]
[Right]
[Beat]One more thing, Lord Korovai.[AN]
We truly do value this partnership,[N]
despite Loewe and I having grievances.[N]
[Beat]Don't give us a reason to end it.[A][X]

[MidRight]
[Beat]I get why you're mad, Epony. I do.[N]
But don't you think they've got a point?[AN]
Our[Beat] I mean, your people died here.[N]
Because they caught wind of what went[N]
down in Shagahn: what we did, Epony.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You[Beat] Listen. Shagahn denied giving[N]
supplies to us. They denied upholding[N]
their duty as vassals of House Freyse.[AN]
[MidRight]
Maybe so, but still, we didn't have to-[AN]
[MidLeft]
Enough! You forget yourself[Beat] Kjell.[AN]
You are no lord; you just bear some[N]
resemblance to one, when cleaned up.[N]
I am the one who made you who you are.[AN]
The one who allowed you to take my[N]
brother's place, for the good of Freyse.[AN]
[MidRight]
And for your own good, don't forget.[AN]
Lord Joakim's bastard, one of many,[N]
couldn't have made it this far alone.[N]
You needed me, Epony, and you still do.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I need someone like you, true.[N]
But anyone can take Korovai's name[N]
and trot about, dancing to my tune.[AN]
One that I have carefully composed,[N]
all for the sake of returning[N]
Freyse to its rightful owner[Beat] me.[AN]
But if you would rather march to your[N]
own beat, then you are free to do so.[AN]
[Beat]But there will be consequences, Kjell.[N]
For your sake, I would suggest that you[N]
do not forget that, going forward.[A][CSSCF]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Oh, I haven't forgotten a thing.[AN]
You lured me in with promises that[N]
we'd finally free our people of Cythes,[N]
but if I knew this was the cost, I[Beat][AN]

After all, yer nothin' but[N]
a grunt in over her head.[AN]
I bet ya that yer bosses don't[N]
even care if ya live or die![AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadTobie]
[Beat]Maybe. Compared to them,[N]
I'm nothing special, sure.[AN]
But they gave me a chance![AN]
Loewe and Cleo chose me to[N]
help them set Freyse free![AN]
So here and now, I'll prove that[N]

[MidRight][LoadMish]
Hey, hey, don't worry.[N]
The stakes aren't gold.[AN]
Take a look at this dagger.[AN]
If I throw it your way,[N]
who's gonna die? Me, or you?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadWrathgar]
Even if that little knife flies[N]
right through my chest,[AN]

So I'll bet on you dyin'![A][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadMish]
Hm[Beat] Guess I should've told[N]

After Cleo and Loewe gave[N]
me a shot in the Liberators,[AN]
I've had to roll these dice[N]
over and over again[Beat][AN][ToggleSmile]

curs askin' me to raise m' axe,[N]

Just a few days ago, a real nasty[N]
piece of work went house to house,[N]
tryin' to rouse us against you lot.[AN]
Those who tried to tell him no[Beat][N]
Well, ya see the homes around here.[AN]

given how much y'all are doing for us[Beat][N]
I've heard th' rumors, but I'm no fool.[AN]
Long as them Cytheans have been here,[N]
they've tried to make us fight our own.[N]
That tool Wrathgar ain't the first.[AN]
But too many listened, and fer what?[N]
Bread on th' table? Gold in yer pockets?[N]
Even my own[Beat] Ah, sorry 'bout that.[AN]
Talked yer ear right off, eh?[N]
Before ya go, let me give ya this.[AN]
I knitted this scarf fer my grandson,[N]
and[Beat] Well, no use keepin' it now.[N]
Hopefully, it'll do ya some good.[AN][X]

[Beat]Not bad, Liberators. Not bad.[N]
Cleo's grown strong, it seems[Beat][AN]
Listen up. I may be pulling back,[N]
