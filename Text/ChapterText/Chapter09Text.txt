[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[Beat]So what is our next goal?[AN]
[MidLeft]
We need to pass through[N]
the Black Forest.[AN]
[Beat]Unfortunately, Cidor already[N] 
has forces there.[AN]
[MidRight]
Doesn't sound like anything we haven't[N]
dealt with before.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Well, apparently the empire has[N]
been recruiting from nearby villages.[AN]
It seems like popular opinion is[N]
turning against us[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I wish I could say I'm surprised.[AN]
Maybe deciding to work with Korovai[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
We've been over this.[AN]
[Beat]In addition, [Red]allegedly some empire[N]
veterans will be arriving soon.[AN]
We'll need to hurry.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Red][Beat]What will stop them[N]
from pursuing us?[AN]
[MidLeft]
There is a gate[N]
within the forest.[AN]
If we pass through[N]
and seal it behind us,[AN]
we should be able to[N]
buy ourselves time to escape.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]It'll have to do.[N]
Let's go join the others.[A][X]

[Beat]Oh Helman, what have I[N]
gotten myself into now?[AN]
Fighting for the empire[Beat][Beat][AN]

## JennySpawnText
[MidRight][LoadJenny]
[Beat]There they are.[N]
The Liberators.[AN]
[Beat]I don't trust these[N]
empire goons.[A] Can what they[N]
say really be true?[AN]
[Red]After what the Liberators[N]
did for my sis[Beat][AN]
If they wanna talk, I[N]
should at least hear em' out.[Red][A][X]


##MeldanSpawnText
[MidRight][LoadMeldan]
Oh me, oh my[Beat][Beat][A]
The time has come.[AN]
[Beat]Oh, I can't do this![AN]
[Red]Not after what the[N]
rebels did for my friend![Red][AN]
Maybe I can sneak away[Beat][Beat][AN]
The empire did say that the[N]
rebels were dangerous[Beat][AN]
[Red]Can't let my guard down.[Red][A][X]

[FarLeft][LoadActive]
[FarRight][LoadJenny]
Liberators! Please, I[N]

My sister always spoke[N]
highly of you.[AN]

her life. I owe you one.[AN]

[FarLeft][LoadActive]
[FarRight][LoadMeldan]
Rebels! Oh, uh, Liberators![AN]
You've been rumored to be[N]
doing ill as of late![AN]
But my good friend Helman[N]
owes you a debt![AN]
So I shall be joining you![AN]
I shall help set you straight![AN]
No need to thank me![AN]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]

##Ch9EndingText2
[FarRight][LoadKorovai]
[Beat][AN]
[CloseEyes]Maybe[Beat][AN]

council was a mistake[Beat][AN]
[FarFarLeft][LoadCleo]
Milord?[AN]
[MoveLeft]
[FarLeft][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight]
[OpenEyes]Oh! There you are.[AN]
You fought well out there.[AN]

Thank you, Milord.[AN]
[FarRight]
[Beat]I must apologize.[AN]
[FarLeft]
???[A]
[Left]
Milord?[A]
[FarRight]
[CloseEyes]..My strategy has turned[N]
my own people against me.[AN]
I thought it would be[N]
necessary to defeat the empire.[AN]
But now the future of Freyse[Beat][AN]
And I've dragged the[N]
Liberators into my mess.[AN]
[Left]
[Beat][A]
[FarLeft]
[Beat][A]
[FarRight]
I'm sorry, I'm sure I've caused[N]
you a great deal of heartache.[AN]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Eh? Who the blazes are ya?[AN]
More of them damned Cythean[N]
curs askin' me to raise m' axe,[N]
or countrymen bowin' at their feet?[AN]
[Beat]Yer with the Liberators, hm?[AN]
Heh, thought I'd never see the day.[N]
Not a lotta folks come through this[N]
forest, 'cept empire bootlickers.[AN]
Just a few days ago, a real nasty[N]
piece of work went house to house,[N]
tryin' to rouse us against you lot.[AN]
Those who tried to tell him no[Beat][N]
Well, ya see the homes around here.[AN]
I told the dastard that he'd get my ol'[N]
woodcuttin' axe to get him off my back,[N]
but y'all came at a great time.[AN]
Take this axe and kill Wrathgar![AN][X]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
A visitor? Not often we get your like[N]
'round here[Beat] And a rebel, ya say?[N]
Then I reckon there's no time fer tea.[AN]
I was hopin' to give ya a bit of rest,[N]
given how much y'all are doing for us[Beat][N]
I've heard th' rumors, but I'm no fool.[AN]
Long as them Cytheans have been here,[N]
they've tried to make us fight our own.[N]
That tool Wrathgar ain't the first.[AN]
But too many listened, and fer what?[N]
Bread on th' table? Gold in yer pockets?[N]
Even my own[Beat] Ah, sorry 'bout that.[AN]
Talked yer ear right off, eh?[N]
Before ya go, let me give ya this.[AN]
I knitted this scarf fer my grandson,[N]
and[Beat] Well, no use keepin' it now.[N]
Hopefully, it'll do ya some good.[AN][X]

## Ch9BrigandText
[MidLeft][Load9Brigand1][ThreeLineBox]
Heh heh heh[Beat] Lookie here![AN]

thanks to them Cytheans[N]
getting here faster 'n us[Beat][AN]
But better than nothin',[.4] I say.[N][.5]
