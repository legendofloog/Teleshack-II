A vistor? What a rare occasion.[N]
This old scroll drifted ashore recently.[N]
I've no use for it, so you can keep it.[A]

[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
Your pathetic rebellion ends[N]

[MidRight][LoadCleo]
It's over, Cidor. Your reign[N]

It's almost over[Beat][N]
Dragana, are you watching?[A][X]

##Ch10CidorMiraBossQuote

Mira, I[Beat][A]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadMira]
There's nothing more to say,[N]
Cidor. Let's finish this.[A][X]

##Ch10CidorIskraBossQuote
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
Byelen forgive me[CloseEyes][Beat][A][X]

I will cut you down, tyrant![A][X]

##Ch10JohannaBossQuote
[MidLeft][LoadJohanna]
You dare challenge me?[N]
This should be amusing.[A][X]

##Ch10EliasBossQuote
[MidLeft][LoadElias]
I'm sorry, but I can't allow your[N]
rebellion to continue any longer.[AN]
On my honor as a knight,[N]
I will grant you a merciful end![A][X]

##Ch10MifanBossQuote
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
I'll cut you down, fiends![N]
Time to pay for your sins![A][X]

##Ch10MifanBuldakBossQuote
[MidRight][LoadBuldak]
Mi, wait! You don't[N]
have to do this.[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
I told you I'd kill you if I[N]
ever saw you again. I intend[AN]
to keep my word.[A][X]

##Ch10MifanValseBossQuote
[MidRight][LoadValse]
Mi, just hear Korovai out.[N]
He ain't such a bad guy![A]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
What's gotten into you?[AN]
How could you side with[N]
that traitor?[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadValse]
I've gotta do what's right.[N]
Mi[Beat] I'm so sorry[Beat][A][X]

##Ch10MifanHornetBossQuote

[Beat][A]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadMifan][TwoLineBox]
Even you've betrayed us[Beat][N]
Then I'll just kill you too![A][X]

##Ch10MifanKorovaiBossQuote
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
I've been waiting for this.[N]
[CloseEyes]At last, I'll have my revenge[Beat][A][X]

##Ch10Start1
[FarLeft][LoadEpony][Left][LoadKorovai][Right][LoadCleo][FarRight][LoadLoewe]
[Left][OneLineBox]
How bad's it look?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
It's[Beat] not great. Cidor's personally[N]
overseeing Castle Freyse's defenses, and[N]
he's roped some of the locals into helping.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Damn, I knew this would happen! We[N]
should have seen this coming, Epony.[N]
You should have seen this coming![A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
What's gotten into you? Our strategy was[N]
always bound to make us some enemies.[AN]
Didn't we agree we'd do whatever it[N]
takes to see Freyse liberated?[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
What's the point when our own people hate[N]
us so much they'd rather bow to Cythes?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Right, we can't allow ourselves[N]
to become enemies to the people[N]
we're trying to help.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Can we salvage this somehow?[N]
Find a way to show the people[N]
of Freyse we're on their side?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
I'll take to the battlefield myself.[N]
Should I encounter any of my people,[N]
I'll try my best to talk them down.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Lord Korovai, you must reconsider![N]
If you fall, our liberation movement[N]
is finished.[AN]
Without the heir to Freyse, we'll have[N]
no more claim to its lands than Cythes![A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
I'm through with having other people fight[N]
my battles. As a warrior, and as a leader,[N]
I cannot back down from this fight.[A]
[X]

##Ch10Start2
[Right][LoadCidor][ThreeLineBox]
Citizens of Freyse, the so-called [0x93]Lord[N]
Korovai" robs you, razes your towns,[N]
and kills your friends and families![AN]
Will you take this lying down, or will[N]
you join me in driving out this tyrant?[A]
[X]

##Ch10Start3
[FarLeft][LoadHornet][Left][LoadValse][MidRight][LoadMifan]
[Left]
So this is really happening[Beat][AN]
Can't say I'm thrilled to be fighting[N]
against our countrymen.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You saw what they've done to us, Valse.[N]
We can't let them continue to trample[N]
all over Freyse![A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Still, this Cidor fella rubs me[N]
the wrong way. My folks back[N]
in Selese ain't too fond of him.[AN]
He taxes the hell outta them[N]
and sends the money straight[N]
to the empire.[AN]
I don't believe for a second[N]
that he's helping us from[N]
the goodness of his heart.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Who cares about that? The enemy of our[N]
enemy is our friend. I'll do whatever it[N]
takes to avenge everyone I've lost.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Can't argue with that, but I'm afraid[N]
we're trading one tyrant for another.[AN]
You've been awfully quiet, Hornet.[N]
What do you think about all this?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Korovai[Beat] I'll look into his eyes,[N]
and if I don't like what I see, I'll[N]
put an arrow between them.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Damn[Beat] You know, you can be[N]
real scary sometimes, Hornet.[A]
[FarFarRight][TwoLineBox]
Hey, you three! Quit your chatting and get[N]
into position. The enemy's nearly upon us![A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
That's our cue.[N]
Try not to die out there, you two![A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Same to you.[A]
[X]

##Ch10HernandezSpawn
[MidLeft][LoadAlenaGrunt2][MidRight][LoadHernandez]
[FarFarRight][OneLineBox]
Stop, thief![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Dammit, Hernandez! I knew we shouldn't[N]
have hit that caravan![A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
How was I supposed to know they'd have[N]
an entire army stationed right here?[N]
You can't blame me for bad luck![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
How did you not know? Did you not see[N]
all those wyverns in the sky?[N]
I can't believe we made you the boss.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Relax. Once we get outta this mess,[N]
I'll buy you a drink and we'll be square.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Unbelievable[Beat][A][X]

## Ch10KorovaiValseTalk
[MidLeft][LoadKorovai][MidRight][LoadValse]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I am Korovai, heir to Freyse. I have no wish[N]
to fight against my people. Please, don't[N]
waste your life here. Lay down your weapon,[AN]
and I can guarantee your safety.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
How can I trust a word you say after all[N]
you've done to us common folk? Nobles like[N]
you love to talk big, but never deliver.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You're right, actions speak louder than[N]
words.[A] I'm more of a fighter than a[N]
politician, so all I can do is take down[N]
Cidor and leave you to return to your lives.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Ya know, I don't see a lot of nobles[N]
fighting on the front lines like you are.[AN]
I'll trust you for now, but I'm gonna[N]
stick around and hold you to your words.[N]
I was never too fond of Cidor anyway.[A][X]

##Ch10KorovaiHornetTalk
[MidLeft][LoadKorovai][MidRight][LoadHornet]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Any last words?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I see so much hatred in your eyes[Beat][N]
While I may deserve your revenge, I[N]
cannot make it up to the people of[N]
Freyse if I'm dead.[A] You deserve better[N]
than being pawns of the empire.[A]
[MidRight]
You don't appear to be lying[Beat][AN]
Few people are as composed as you when[N]
facing death. I'll trust you for now.[N]
Pray you don't disappoint me.[A]
[X]

##Ch10ValseHornetTalk
[MidLeft][LoadValse][MidRight][LoadHornet]
[MidLeft]
Hey, Hornet, I really think you should[N]
hear out this Korovai fella. He doesn't[N]
seem like such a bad guy.[A]
[MidRight]
Alright[Beat][A]
[X]

##Ch10HornetValseTalk
[MidLeft][LoadHornet][MidRight][LoadValse]
[MidRight]
Hey, Hornet, what's going on? Why're you[N]
fighting with the liberators?[A]
[MidLeft]
His eyes looked sincere[Beat][A]
[MidRight]
You can tell just from his eyes? Well, I[N]
suppose it can't hurt to hear him out.[A]
[X]

##Ch10JohannaSpawn_v2
[MidLeft][LoadCidor][MidRight][LoadJohanna]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Duke Cidor, I'm here under General Argymos's[N]
orders to put an end to this rebellion.[AN]
With Selese's finest at my command,[N]
these rebels won't stand a chance.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Is General Argymos in Freyse?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Indeed. In fact, he's on his way here as[N]
we speak. Even so, I'd rather we rout the[N]
liberators before he arrives.[AN]
I've been itching for a good fight.[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Argymos[Beat] Why would he come here himself?[AN]
I cannot allow myself to fall[N]
further into his debt.[A]
[X]

## Ch10EliasSpawm
[Left][LoadElias][ThreeLineBox]
The battle's still going? Perhaps[N]
I underestimated them. No matter,[N]
I'll just have to finish this myself.[A][X]

##Ch10End1
[Left][LoadCidor][Right][LoadKorovai][FarRight][LoadLoewe]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Gah[Beat][A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
It's over, Cidor. Freyse will never[N]
again bow to the empire![A]
[Left]
You damn fools[Beat][N]
If only you could understand[Beat][A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Enough! We don't need to listen[N]
to your excuses![A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Loewe, more dracoknights inbound[N]
from the west![A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Reinforcements?[A]

[FarFarRight][MoveFarRight]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
That wyvern[Beat] Loewe, stop![N]
You must not fight that man![A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Now you've truly doomed us all[Beat][A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
What are you talking about?[N]
Cleo, what's going on?[A]
[FarFarLeft][LoadElias]
[FarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
This is[Beat] unexpected.[AN]
Cleo[Beat] I knew you turned against Cythes,[N]
but I never imagined you'd be heading this[N]
force. And Cidor, how did you manage to[AN]
lose, even after all the support the empire[N]
provided you?[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Urgh[Beat][A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Brother[Beat][A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
How I wish our reunion could have been[N]
under better circumstances[Beat][AN]
I don't fault you for deserting. Even with[N]
all your training, the realities of war[N]
are cruel and your heart is too kind.[AN]
Yet, as loathsome as Cythes's campaign[N]
may be, it must succeed all the same.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
And this includes the occupation of[N]
Decia? The countless atrocities the[N]
empire has committed towards innocents[AN]
for the sake of its ambitions?[A]
[FarLeft]
Not a day goes by that I don't lament the[N]
suffering Cythes has caused, but even so,[N]
I cannot waver. Too much is at stake.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
I didn't know Cleo's brother was a[N]
Cythean knight, but she always spoke[N]
highly of you. Yet you're spouting[AN]
this nonsense? If you believe the reason[N]
for Cythes's conquest beyond mere greed,[AN]
just tell us![A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
General, you can't[Beat][A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
If only I could tell you, but regrettably it must[N]
remain a secret. If this information were to[N]
spread, the consequences would be dire.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
So, where does this leave us? You won't tell[N]
us anything, and you've come with a squad of[N]
dracoknights. Must we truly fight here?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Fortunately, there's no need for that.[AN]
My orders were to assist Duke Cidor,[N]
and considering he can barely stand,[N]
we've no choice but to retreat.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
You think we're going to let him get away?[N]
Cleo's brother or not, I can't let you do this![A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Loewe, I'm sorry. I want to avenge Dragana[N]
as much as you, but this is a fight we can't[N]
win. We're all exhausted from the battle,[AN]
and even if we weren't, Elias is one of the[N]
strongest knights in all of Cythes.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Goodbye, Cleo. I'll pray for your[N]
continued safety.[A]

[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Dragana[Beat] We were so close.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
We'll get Cidor next time. He's[N]
escaped justice far too long.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Cleo, I think I may have a clue about the[N]
secrets your brother is hiding. Have you[N]
heard of the Forbidden Passages?[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
The Forbidden Passages[Beat][N]
That does sound familiar.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
They're said to be lost to time, but the[N]
late Lord Joakim caught wind of rumors[N]
that Cythes unearthed some of them.[AN]
They're said to speak of great calamity,[N]
and that their secrets may bring Orodreth[N]
salvation, or ruin.[AN]
Of course, all of this is still hearsay.[N]
I've never even met anyone who's read them,[N]
or even confirmed they exist.[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Thank you, Epony. Any clues are helpful[N]
when there's so little we know.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Will you two stay in Freyse, or join us[N]
in liberating the rest of Decia?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
I wish I could help bring down Cidor[N]
for good, but it's time I put Freyse[N]
first for a change.[AN]
Freyse needs a leader, and I need to[N]
make up for my prior failings.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
I'm staying as well, but the rest of[N]
our fighters will remain with you.[AN]
After all, the liberation of Decia[N]
is in Freyse's best interest.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Thanks, we won't disappoint.[A]

Excuse me, I believe I'm supposed[N]
to give this to you.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
A sword? Where'd you get this?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
A strange man told me to give[N]
this to the blonde mage if[N]
Duke Cidor was defeated.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
How strange[Beat][A][X]

## Ch10WellworthIntroduction
[MidLeft][LoadWellworth][ThreeLineBox]
Back on the frontlines again[Beat][N]
Now this is where I belong, instead[N]
of a throne. Come at me, Liberators![A][X]

## Ch10TheGiantIntroduction
[MidLeft][LoadTheGiant][ThreeLineBox]
Looks like I'm holding a bridge this time,[N]
instead of a gate. Everyone, hold firm![N]
Mi's counting on us, so stand strong![A][X]

## Ch10YorIntroduction
[MidLeft][LoadYor][ThreeLineBox]
Those Liberators finally showed up?[N]
Good. Alright, boys, you watching?[N]
Guide my spear into their skulls![AN][X]

## Ch10BuldakIntroduction
[MidLeft][LoadBuldak][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]There's no turning back now,[N]
is there? Our chances are slim,[N]
but I won't run, Mi! I swear it![A][X]

## Ch10MifanResolution
[MidLeft][LoadMifan][ThreeLineBox]
The criminals who razed Shagahn to[N]
the ground are within my blade's reach.[N]
Vengeance is at hand[Beat] But not yet.[AN]
I'll only have one chance at this,[N]
so I have to make it count.[N]
One chance at their heads[Beat][A][X]

## Ch10MifanCharge
[MidLeft][LoadMifan][ThreeLineBox]
With that woman's troops distracting them,[N]
I'll have no better opportunity than this.[N]
The time to charge is now. For Shagahn![A][X]

## Ch10MifanCaptureQuoteText
[MidLeft][LoadMifan][ThreeLineBox]

will make me forget what you all did?[N]
No[Beat] This isn't over. Not yet.[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadYor][ThreeLineBox]

Sorry, boys. I couldn't avenge you.[N]
The next drinks[Beat] are on me[Beat][A][CloseEyes][X]

## Ch10WellworthCaptureQuoteText

Pah! Some Great Wellworth I am[Beat][N]
Maybe I should just retire.[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadWellworth][ThreeLineBox]

[MidRight][LoadIskra]
More Selesians, hm? My father could[N]
be one of the men facing us now[Beat][AN]
Mom never said he was a bad guy,[N]
but a traitor's a traitor, right?[AN]
If he stands against the Liberators,[N]
then he's just an enemy in our way.[AN]
I can't show mercy to anyone, even him[Beat][A][X]
