##Ch10MifanBuldakBossQuote
[MidRight][LoadBuldak]

have to do this.[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
I told you I'd kill you if I[N]

##Ch10MifanValseBossQuote
[MidRight][LoadValse]
Mi, just hear Radnitz out.[N]
He ain't such a bad guy![A]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
What's gotten into you?[N]
How could you side with[AN]
that traitor?[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadValse]
I've gotta do what's right.[N]

[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
I've been waiting for this.[N]
[CloseEyes]At last, I'll have my revenge[Beat][A][X]

##Ch10Start1
[FarLeft][LoadEpony][Left][LoadRadnitz][Right][LoadCleo][FarRight][LoadLoewe]
[Left][OneLineBox]
How bad's it look?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
It's... not great. Cidor's personally[N]
overseeing Castle Freyse's defenses, and[N]
he's roped some of the locals into helping.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Damn, I knew this would happen! We[N]
should have seen this coming, Epony.[N]
You should have seen this coming![A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
What's gotten into you? Our strategy was[N]
was always bound to make us some enemies.[AN]
Didn't we agree we'd do whatever it[N]
takes to see Freyse liberated?[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
What's the point when our own people hate[N]
us so much they'd rather bow to Cythes?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Right, we can't allow ourselves[N]
to become enemies to the people[N]
we're trying to help.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Can we salvage this somehow?[N]
Find a way to show the people[N]
of Freyse we're on their side?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
I'll take to the battlefield myself.[N]
Should I encounter any of my people,[N]
I'll try my best to talk them down.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Load Radnitz, you must reconsider![N]
If you fall, our liberation movement[N]
is finished.[AN]
Without the heir to Freyse, we'll have[N]
no more claim to its lands than Cythes![A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
I'm through with having other people fight[N]
my battles. As a warrior, and as a leader,[N]
I cannot back down from this fight.[A]
[X]

##Ch10Start2
[Right][LoadCidor][ThreeLineBox]
Citizens of Freyse, the so-called [0x93]Lord[N]
Radnitz" robs you, razes your towns,[N]
and kills your friends and families![AN]
Will you take this lying down, or will[N]
you join me in driving out this tyrant?[A]
[X]

##Ch10Start3
[FarLeft][LoadHornet][Left][LoadValse][MidRight][LoadMifan]
[Left]
So this is really happening...[AN]
Can't say I'm thrilled to be fightning[N]
against our countrymen.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You saw what they've done to us, Valse.[N]
We can't let them continue to trample[N]
all over Freyse![A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Still, this Cidor fella rubs me the wrong[N]
way. My folks back in Selese ain't too fond[N]
of him. He taxes the hell outta them and[AN]
sends the money straight to the empire.[AN]
I don't believe for a second that he's[N]
helping us from the goodness of his heart.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Who cares about that? The enemy of our[N]
enemy is our friend. I'll do whatever it[N]
takes to avenge everyone I've lost.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Can't argue with that, but I'm afraid[N]
we're trading one tyrant for another.[AN]
You've been awfully quiet, Hornet.[N]
What do you think about all this?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Radnitz... I'll look into his eyes,[N]
and if I don't like what I see, I'll[N]
put an arrow between them.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Damn... You know, you can be[N]
real scary sometimes, Hornet.[A]
[FarFarRight][TwoLineBox]
Hey, you three! Quit your chatting and get[N]
into position. The enemy's nearly upon us![A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
That's our cue.[N]
Try not to die out there, you two![A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Same to you.[A]

##Ch10HernandezSpawn
[MidLeft][LoadAlenaGrunt2][MidRight][LoadHernandez]
[FarFarRight][OneLineBox]
Stop, thief![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Dammit, Hernandez! I knew we shouldn't[N]
have hit that caravan![A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
How was I supposed to know they'd have[N]
an entire army stationed right here?[N]
You can't blame me for bad luck![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
How did you not know? Did you not see[N]
all those wyverns in the sky?[N]
I can't believe we made you the boss.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Relax, once we get outta this mess I'll[N]
buy you a drink and we'll be square.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Unbelievable...[A]
[X]

##Ch10RadnitzValseTalk
[MidLeft][LoadRadnitz][MidRight][LoadValse]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I am Radnitz, heir to Freyse. I have no wish[N]
to fight against my people. Please, don't[N]
waste your life here. Lay down your weapon,[AN]
and I can guarantee your safety.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
How can I trust a word you say after all[N]
you've done to us common folk? Nobles like[N]
you love to talk big, but never deliver.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You're right, actions speak louder than[N]
words. I'm more of a fighter than a[AN]
politician, so all I can do is take down[N]
Cidor and leave you to return to your lives.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Ya know, I don't see a lot of nobles[N]
fighting on the front lines like you are.[AN]
I'll trust you for now, but I'm gonna[N]
stick around and hold you to your words.[N]
I was never too fond of Cidor anyway.[A]
[X]

##Ch10RadnitzHornetTalk
[MidLeft][LoadRadnitz][MidRight][LoadHornet]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Any last words?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I see so much hatred in your eyes[Beat][N]
While I may deserve your revenge, I[AN]
cannot make it up to the people of[N]
Freyse if I'm dead. You deserve better[N]
than being pawns of the empire.[A]
[MidRight]
You don't appear to be lying[Beat][AN]
Few people are as composed as you when[N]
facing death. I'll trust you for now. Pray[N]
you don't disappoint me.[A]
[X]

##Ch10ValseHornetTalk
[MidLeft][LoadValse][MidRight][LoadHornet]
[MidLeft]
Hey, Hornet, I really think you should[N]
hear out this Radnitz fella. He doesn't[N]
seem like such a bad guy.[A]
[MidRight]
Alright[Beat][A]
[X]

##Ch10HornetValseTalk
[MidLeft][LoadHornet][MidRight][LoadValse]
[MidRight]
Hey, Hornet, what's going on? Why're you[N]
fighting with the liberators?[A]
[MidLeft]
His eyes looked sincere[Beat][A]
[MidRight]
You can tell just from his eyes? Well, I[N]
suppose it can't hurt to hear him out.[A]
[X]

##Ch10JohannaSpawn
[MidLeft][LoadCidor][MidRight][LoadJohanna]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Duke Cidor, I'm here under General Argymos's[N]
orders to put an end to this rebellion.[AN]
Should they cross the bridge, I'll swoop in[N]
with my dracoknights and finish them off.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Is General Argymos in Freyse?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Indeed. In fact, he's on his way here as[N]
we speak. Even so, I'd rather we rout the[N]
liberators before he arrives.[AN]
I've been itching for a good fight.[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Argymos[Beat]
Why would he come here himself?[AN]
I cannot allow myself to fall further[N]
into his debt.[A]
[X]

##Ch10JohannaSpawn_v2
[MidLeft][LoadCidor][MidRight][LoadJohanna]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Duke Cidor, I'm here under General Argymos's[N]
orders to put an end to this rebellion.[AN]
With Selese's finest at my command,[N]
these rebels won't stand a chance.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Is General Argymos in Freyse?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Indeed. In fact, he's on his way here as[N]
we speak. Even so, I'd rather we rout the[N]
liberators before he arrives.[AN]
I've been itching for a good fight.[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Argymos[Beat]
Why would he come here himself?[AN]
I cannot allow myself to fall further[N]
into his debt.[A]

##Ch10JohannaCharge
[MidLeft][LoadCidor][MidRight][LoadJohanna]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Looks like General Argymos was right to[N]
send me. No matter, my dracoknights will[N]
will crush them![AN]
[X]

##Ch10MifanCharge
[Right][LoadMifan]
Grandfather, everyone[Beat][N]
Now I can finally avenge you![A]
[X]

##Ch10EliasSpawm
[Left][LoadElias][ThreeLineBox]
The battle's still going? Perhaps I[N]
underestimated them. No matter, I'll[N]
just have to finish this myself.[A]
[X]

##Ch10End1
[Left][LoadCidor][Right][LoadRadnitz][FarRight][LoadLoewe]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Gah[Beat][A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
It's over, Cidor. Freyse will never[N]
again bow to the empire![A]
[Left]
You damn fools[Beat][N]
If only you could understand[Beat][A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Enough! We don't need to listen[N]
to your excuses![A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Loewe, more dracoknights inbound[N]
from the west![A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Reinforcements?[A]
[Right][ClearFace]

You must not fight that man![A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Now you've truly doomed us all[Beat][A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
What are you talking about?[N]
Cleo, what's going on?[A]
[FarFarLeft][LoadElias]
[FarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
This is[Beat] unexpected.[AN]
Cleo[Beat] I knew you turned against Cythes,[N]
but I never imagined you'd be heading this[N]
force. And Cidor, how did you manage to[AN]
lose, even after all the supprt the empire[N]
provided you?[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Urgh[Beat][A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Brother[Beat][A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
How I wish our reunion could have been[N]
under better circumstances[Beat][AN]
I don't fault you for deserting. Even with[N]
all your training, the realities of war[N]
are cruel and your heart is too kind.[AN]
Yet, as loathsome as Cythes's campaign[N]
may be, it must succeed all the same.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
And this includes the occupation of[N]
Decia? The countless atrocities the[N]
empire has committed towards innocents[AN]
for the sake of its ambitions?[A]
[FarLeft]
Not a day goes by that I don't lament the[N]
suffering Cythes has caused, but even so,[N]
I cannot waver. Too much is at stake.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
I didn't know Cleo's brother was a[N]
Cythean knight, but she always spoke[N]
highly of you. Yet you're spouting[AN]
this nonsense? If you believe the reason[N]
for Cythes's conquest beyond mere greed,[AN]
just tell us![A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
General, you can't[Beat][A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
If only I could tell you, but regrettably it must[N]
remain a secret. If this information were to[N]
spread, the consequences would be dire.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
So, where does this leave us? You won't tell[N]
us anything, and you've come with a squad of[N]
dracoknights. Must we truly fight here?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Fortunately, there's no need for that.[AN]
My orders were to assist Duke Cidor,[N]
and considering he can barely stand,[N]
we've no choice but to retreat.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
You think we're going to let him get away?[N]
Cleo's brother or not, I can't let you do this![A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Loewe, I'm sorry. I want to avenge Dragana[N]
as much as you, but this is a fight we can't[N]
win. We're all exhausted from the battle,[AN]
and even if we weren't, Elias is one of the[N]
strongest knights in all of Cythes.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Goodbye, Cleo. I'll pray for your[N]
continued safety.[A]

It's the Argymos family crest. He'd never[N]

##Ch10End2
[FarLeft][LoadEpony][Left][LoadRadnitz][Right][LoadCleo][FarRight][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Dragana[Beat] We were so close.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
We'll get Cidor next time. He's[N]
escaped justice far too long.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Cleo, I think I may have a clue about the[N]
secrets your brother is hiding. Have you[N]
heard of the Forbidden Passages?[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
The Forbidden Passages[Beat][N]
That does sound familiar.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
They're said to be lost to time, but the[N]
late Lord Joakim caught wind of rumors[N]
that Cythes unearthed some of them.[AN]
They're said to speak of great calamity,[N]
and that their secrets may bring Orodreth[N]
salvation, or ruin.[AN]
Of course, all of this is still hearsay.[N]
I've never even met anyone who's read them,[N]
or even confirmed they exist.[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Thank you, Epony. Any clues are helpful[N]
when there's so little we know.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Will you two stay in Freyse, or join us[N]
in liberating the rest of Decia?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
I wish I could help bring down Cidor[N]
for good, but it's time I put Freyse[N]
first for a change.[AN]
Freyse needs a leader, and I need to[N]
make up for my prior failings.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
I'm staying as well, but the rest of[N]
our fighters will remain with you.[AN]
After all, the liberation of Decia[N]
is in Freyse's best interest.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Thanks, we won't disappoint.[A]
