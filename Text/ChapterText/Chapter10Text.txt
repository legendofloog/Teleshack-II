Castle Freyse[X]

## Ch10_WM_Text
As General Elias and his squadron[N]
of dracoknights give up their hunt,[AN]
the Liberators breathe a sigh of relief.[AN]
Their march to Castle Freyse resumes[N]
unfettered, save by their own hearts.[AN][Event]
Duke Cidor, the man who stole their hopes,[N]
awaits them at the gates of Peranth:[AN]
the long-standing capital of Freyse.[AN][Event]
Some Liberators hold hope that defeating[N]
him is no longer just an idle dream.[AN][Event]
Still others believe that even if it is,[AN]
they must try regardless, or their fallen[N]
general's sacrifice will mean nothing.[AN][Event]
But all are certain that Freyse's liberation,[N]
and Decia's to come, lives or dies today...[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadJohanna][ThreeLineBox]
I see the banner of House Freyse[Beat][N]
General Elias will want a report.[AN]
While I'm gone, don't move an inch.[N]
Otherwise, I'll have your head.[AN]
[MidRight]
We hardly have enough men as it is,[N]
Captain Johanna. Would taking my head[N]
do you any good, even if I faltered?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Don't lecture me, blueblood.[N]
I know better than anyone-[AN]
[MidRight]
That a half-trained militia makes up[N]
much of our defense against the rebels?[N]
That we stand here, in dire straits?[AN]
[Beat]This militia you've raised will do[N]
naught but die in droves, all to buy time[N]
for your general's belated arrival![AN]
[MidLeft]
Watch yourself, speaking like that.[N]
You may be an ally of ours, but don't[N]
forget who lets you keep your station.[AN]
Besides[Beat] Your countrymen are the same[N]
ones trying to take Castle Freyse, now.[AN]
If no Decians rose to stop them[Beat][N]
Well, that would give our emperor[N]
a bit of pause, don't you think?[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes, it would, which is why I and[N]
my retinue came here. To show our[Beat][N]
devotion to the Cythean Empire.[AN]
Surely, we are enough to repel-[AN]
[MidLeft]
Enough, Cidor. My decision is final;[N]
we won't turn down anyone who wants[N]
to fight, no matter their skill.[AN]
[Beat]Anyway, I'd better get going.[N]
Try to hold out until I get back[Beat][N]
And leave some of the fighting for me![A][CSSCF]
[MidRight]
Oh, I will. And with any luck,[N]
enough will be left that you fall[N]
on your axe. Contemptible woman![AN]
Were she or her general more devoted[N]
to their work, we would have no need[N]
for peasants who know only pitchforks[Beat][AN]
But hypotheticals mean nothing.[N]
Dragana's successors close in[Beat][N]
Today, I finish what I started![AN][X]

//then, these three get to talk: show the three militia characters
//Mifan/Valse/Hornet scene can be amended slightly as some parts of it have already been covered in Chapter 9.
//It should still show Valse and Hornetâ€™s doubts, but Mifan pushes back and reminds them of why they're there. They both tentatively agree, before heading off to their positions.
//Both of the recruits tentatively agree, though more reluctantly, and as the Liberators arrive, Mifan comments that Today, it all ends. Shagahn will be avenged!

So this is really happening[Beat][N]
Can't say I'm thrilled to be fightin'[N]
against countrymen. That's for sure.[A]
[MidRight]
Don't tell me you're getting cold feet[N]
now, Valse. Did you forget all that[N]
they've done? The sins they've committed?[AN]
[Left]
No, I didn't forget your story, Mifan.[N]
But I don't know[Beat] This Cidor fella[N]
and the Cytheans rub me the wrong way.[AN]
My folks back in Selese ain't too fond[N]
of the duke. He taxes the hell outta[N]
them and sends it straight to Cythes.[AN]
And speakin' of, you guys ever see the[N]
way that Captain Johanna looks at us?[N]
Makes me feel like nothin' but fodder.[AN]
[MidRight]
She can think what she likes. So long[N]
as we can avenge everyone in Shagahn,[N]
it makes no difference to me.[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]The enemy of our enemy's a friend,[N]
huh? You've been awfully quiet, Hornet.[N]
What do you think about all this?[A]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]I don't like our leaders, either.[N]
Whether they're worse than Korovai[Beat][N]
Well, we'll all know, soon enough.[AN]
[FarFarRight][LoadSoldier]
Hey, you three! Quit your chatting[N]
and get into position, already.[N]
The enemy's nearly upon us![A]
[Left]
Guess that's our cue, ain't it?[N]
Phew, I'm gettin' the pre-fight jitters![N]
Let's all make it out alive, yeah?[A]
[MidRight]
Right. Valse, Hornet[Beat] Whatever comes[N]
next, I appreciate everything that you've[N]
done for me over the past couple weeks.[AN]
[Beat]No matter what happens today,[N]
I just wanted you to know that. Now,[N]
let's end this, once and for all![A][X]

[FarRight][LoadLoewe]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
You must've got an eye on things[N]
while you were flying up there,[N]
Loewe. What's the situation?[AN]
[FarRight]
Looks like Cidor and his snakes[N]
roped in another Decian militia.[N]
[Beat]Do you remember what I said?[AN]
[Left]
I understand your position, Loewe.[N]
And[Beat] Well[Beat] I'm sorry, really.[N]
For everything I've done so far.[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]Sorry? I never expected you to[N]
apologize, Lord Korovai. What caused[N]
this change of heart? I'm curious.[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]It's been overdue. That business[N]
back in the forest, with Wrathgar[Beat][N]
I've done wrong by you. By them, too.[AN]
[Beat]Even still, we can't quit now.[AN]
Cidor and the Cytheans keep sacrificing[N]
our people's lives, over and over again.[N]
Someone has to stop them. We have to-[AN]
[FarRight][LoadLoeweAngry]
You haven't lifted a damn finger[N]
to end any of this suffering![N]
Hell, you've made it worse![AN]
[Left]
[Beat]And that ends today. Epony, fetch[N]
me my lance. I'm healed up enough now[N]
to prove that I mean every word I say![AN]
[FarRight][LoadLoewe]
[FarLeft]
Are you mad, K-Korovai?[N]
Your role is to lead from[N]
the back, not to go and die-[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]My role is my choice, not yours.[AN]
And I choose to stand with my subjects![N]
I choose to put it all on the line,[N]
for the sake of Freyse's liberation![AN]
And if my decision kills me, well[Beat][N]
then at least I'll die doing the right[N]
thing, for once.[ToggleSmile] Heh, imagine that.[AN]
[FarLeft][ToggleSmile]
You[Beat] Bah, forget it! If you refuse[N]
to listen to my counsel, then you can[N]
only blame yourself for what follows.[AN][CSSCF]
[Left]
Hm[Beat] Well, let's hear it, Liberators.[AN]
Are you leaving, or are you staying?[N]
There's not much time to decide;[N]
General Elias is still hunting us.[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]My mind hasn't changed, Loewe.[AN]
We won't have any better chance[N]
to weaken Cythes's hold over Freyse[N]
than capturing the castle today.[AN]
Our actions here have depleted their [N]
forces to rely on novice soldiers,[N]
but when Elias finally arrives[Beat][AN]
His reinforcements will descend[N]
upon us like voracious vultures.[AN]
And they won't let go of the castle,[N]
if we leave it in their hands[Beat][N]
Loewe, you know what we have to do.[A]
[FarRight]
[Beat]Yeah, yeah. Alright, Korovai,[N]
you win. If you're willing to risk[N]
your own hide, then I'll stick around.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Besides, if Cidor's stupid enough to[N]
fight here himself, then wouldn't it be[N]
rude to leave him waiting at the gate?[AN][LoadLoeweAngry][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Seriously, though. Make sure we take[N]
Cidor alive, Korovai: that's all I ask.[N]
A warrior's death is too good for him.[AN]
[Left]
Sure, suit yourself. If that's all,[N]
then let's get to work, Liberators![N]
One last battle, and we're free![A][X]

[MidRight][LoadIskra][ThreeLineBox]
More Selesians, hm? My father could[N]
be one of the men facing us now[Beat][AN]
Mom never said he was a bad guy,[N]
but a traitor's a traitor, right?[AN]
If he stands against the Liberators,[N]
then he's just an enemy in our way.[N]
I can't show mercy to anyone, even him[Beat][A][X]

## Ch10WellworthIntroduction
[MidLeft][LoadWellworth][ThreeLineBox]
Back on the frontlines again[Beat][N]
Now this is where I belong, instead[N]
of a throne. Come at me, Liberators![A][X]

## Ch10TheGiantIntroduction
[MidLeft][LoadTheGiant][ThreeLineBox]
Looks like I'm holding a bridge this time,[N]
instead of a gate. Everyone, hold firm![N]
Mi's counting on us, so stand strong![A][X]

## Ch10YorIntroduction
[MidLeft][LoadYor][ThreeLineBox]
Those Liberators finally showed up?[N]
Good. Alright, boys, you watching?[N]
Guide my spear into their skulls![AN][X]

[MidLeft][LoadBuldak][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]There's no turning back now,[N]
is there? Our chances are slim,[N]
but I won't run, Mi! I swear it![A][X]

## Ch10MifanResolution
[MidLeft][LoadMifan][ThreeLineBox]
The criminals who razed Shagahn to[N]
the ground are within my blade's reach.[N]
Vengeance is at hand[Beat] But not yet.[AN]
I'll only have one chance at this,[N]
so I have to make it count.[N]
One chance at their heads[Beat][A][X]

## Ch10MifanCharge
[MidLeft][LoadMifan][ThreeLineBox]
With that woman's troops distracting them,[N]
I'll have no better opportunity than this.[N]
The time to charge is now. For Shagahn![A][X]

Stop, thief![A]
[MidLeft]
Dammit, Hernandez![N]
I knew we shouldn't[N]
have hit that caravan![A]
[MidRight]
How was I supposed to know they'd have[N]
an entire army stationed right here?[N]
You can't blame me for bad luck![A]
[MidLeft]
How did you not know? Did you not[N]
see all those wyverns in the sky?[N]
I can't believe we made you the boss.[A]
[MidRight]
Relax. Once we get outta[N]
this mess, I'll buy you[N]
a drink and we'll be square.[A]

Unbelievable[Beat][A][X]

## Ch10KorovaiValseTalk
[MidLeft][LoadKorovai]
[MidRight][LoadValse][ThreeLineBox]
You're Lord Korovai, ain't ya?[N]
[Beat]Looking as fancy as I thought.[N]
How much did that armor cost?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Too much. That's about all I know.[AN]
[Beat]Look, I don't want to fight against[N]
my own people, so why not walk away?[N]
I can guarantee your safety, if you do.[AN]
[MidRight]
How can I trust a word you say after all[N]
you've done to us common folk? Nobles like[N]
you love to talk big, but never deliver.[A]
[MidLeft]
You're right; talk is cheap. That's why[N]
I'm here, taking the fight to Cidor[N]
and the Cytheans that he bows down to.[AN]
Once Freyse is free, I'll do everything[N]
I can to restore things to the way they[N]
used to be[Beat] Well? Are you with me?[AN] 
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You've got a point. I don't see Cythean[N]
lords risking their lives like you[Beat][N][ToggleSmile]
Ah, to hell with it. You've got my lance![AN]
'Course, I'll stick around and make sure[N]
you hold up your end of things, milord.[N]
The name's Valse. Pleasure to meet you![AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha, likewise. And I'd want it no other[N]
way. If I ever overstep[Beat] Well, let's[N]
not worry about that right now, hm?[N]
We've got a battle to win![A][X]

## Ch10KorovaiHornetTalk

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
One wrong move, and the arrow flies.[N]
[Beat]Any last words, Lord Korovai?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That hatred in your eyes[Beat] I've seen[N]
it before, and no doubt, I deserve it.[N]
I've committed enough crimes, already.[AN]
But if I die here, then what happened[N]
in Shagahn won't mean a damn thing![N]
I want to[Beat] No, I need to atone.[AN]
And the only way I can do that is to[N]
free Freyse from Cythes's occupation.[N]
[Beat]Our people deserve that much.[AN]
[MidRight]
You don't appear to be lying[Beat][AN]
Few people are as composed as you when[N]
facing death. I'll trust you for now.[N]
Pray you don't disappoint me.[A][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Wait, she's falling in with us?[N]
That's[Beat] surprising, but no sense[N]
in looking a gift horse in the mouth.[AN]
Onward, everyone! We can do this![AN][X]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'm back, Duke Cidor. Looks like you[N]
haven't made much progress[Beat] Bah![N]
Men, to arms. Let's do it ourselves![A]
[MidLeft]
What folly is this? You said that[N]
we were to wait for General Elias,[N]
and now, you intend to charge?[AN]
[MidRight]
The way things are going, there won't[N]
be any of us left when he gets here.[N]
Besides, I've been itching for a fight![AN]
Ah, your orders still stand, duke.[N]
Stay here and watch as I take all[N]
the glory, alright? Hahahaha![A][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That buffoon[Beat] This is who Elias[N]
trusted to defend Castle Freyse?[N]
Hmph[Beat] If she wants to die, so be it.[AN]

until the general finally arrives[Beat][AN][X]

## Ch10EliasSpawn
[Left][LoadElias][ThreeLineBox]
The battle's still going? Hm[Beat][AN]
Johanna and Cidor may have failed,[N]
but with this force at my back,[N]

than it has to be. Please.[AN][X]

[FarRight][LoadLoewe]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
H-He's here[Beat] Loewe, we aren't[N]
outrunning him. Not this time.[AN]
Look at how many dracoknights[N]
that he's brought with him[Beat][N]
They'll surround us in seconds.[AN]
[FarRight]
Hate to say it, but you're right.[N]
Even if we take down Cidor,[N]
there's no getting out of this.[AN]
[Beat]But if that's how it is,[N]
then I want to go down fighting.[AN]
[Right]
I understand that it seems hopeless,[N]
but getting ourselves killed would[N]
only dishonor Dragana's memory.[AN]
[Beat]Do you trust me, Loewe?[AN]
[FarRight]
Strange thing to ask now, y'know[Beat][N]
Of course I do, Cleo. We've been[N]
through enough together, by now.[AN]
[Right]
Then believe me when I say that we only[N]
have one way out of this: surrendering.[AN]
General Elias is a reasonable man.[N]
If we throw down our weapons, then[N]
he'll allow the Liberators to survive.[AN]
[FarRight]
I knew I wasn't gonna like what you[N]
had to say, but if it's that or death[Beat][AN]
They're definitely gonna lock us up[N]
and make sure we can't rise up again,[N]
but[Beat][ToggleSmile] We've broken out of jail once.[AN]
All we have to do is do it again, yeah?[A][ToggleSmile]
[Right]
Ha, I never knew you to be an optimist,[N]
Loewe[Beat] But that's our only hope, now.[N]
We can only pray that that's enough[Beat][A][X]

I've heard a lot of talk about who's[N]
right and who's wrong, but if y'all[N]
went out of your way to warn me,[AN]
then you're alright in my book.[AN]
[Beat]Say, if you're aimin' to take[N]
Castle Freyse, it ain't gonna be[N]
easy. Why not use this staff?[AN]
Helps you focus up and land hits,[N]
even if the enemy's got a good[N]
foothold. Best of luck, Liberators![A][X]

So, you've made it this far[Beat][AN]
Impressive, but your attempt[N]
at a rebellion will end here.[AN]
If you choose to surrender,[N]
then I may spare your lives.[AN]
But if you reject my offer,[AN]
you will receive no mercy.[N]
[Beat]Very well. If that is[N]

I pray that you meet General[N]

[MidRight][LoadCleo]
Duke Cidor[Beat] I must admit,[AN]
I hadn't expected that you[N]
would show your face here.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
[Beat]I have a duty to uphold,[AN]
as the duke of Selese and[N]
Decian envoy to Cythes.[AN]
It is only due to performing[N]
that duty that Decia still[Beat][AN]
Well, that it still has[N]
some semblance of freedom.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
Freedom? Cythean patrols[N]
hover over each town.[AN]
It may not be martial law,[N]
but it's close enough.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
Then imagine how much worse[N]
it could've been, Cleo.[AN]
You should know better than[N]
anyone what Cythes can do.[AN]
What Cythes has done, even[N]
with my cooperation![AN]
I have done everything just[N]
to hold my country together![A][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadCleoAngry]
[Beat]Everything? You never[N]
even attempted to fight back.[AN]
General Dragana was right[N]
about you. You're a coward![AN]
If the two of you had stood[N]
together, then maybe you-[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
Pondering on the past now[N]
is a meaningless venture,[AN]
and even moreso coming from[N]
a Cythean beyond her ken.[AN]
You stand here today only due[N]
to your guilt. Nothing more![AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadCleoAngry]
Even if that's true, what[N]
does it matter, in the end?[AN]
I'm here to do the right thing,[N]
just as the general would have![AN]
And in her stead[Beat] I'll bring[N]
your reign to an end, Cidor![A][X]

## Ch10CidorLoeweBQ

Nowhere to run, Cidor[Beat][N]
You got any last words?[AN]
I'll let you say your piece,[N]
and then, you're a dead man.[AN][CSSCF][ToggleSmile]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
Do you truly believe that[N]
you can defeat me, Loewe?[AN]
You, who could only watch[N]
as I killed General Dragana?[AN]
Why would you succeed where[N]
she, a former knight, failed?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadLoeweAngry]
[Beat]You only beat her because[N]
she was on her last legs.[AN]
You starved Dragana and[N]
locked her in a dark cell[Beat][AN][ToggleSmile]
And even then, she almost[N]
got you in your own castle.[AN]
What's that say to you?[AN][CSSCF][ToggleSmile]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
A fair point. But even in[N]
ideal conditions for her,[AN]
we were an even match.[AN]
Do you think that you've[N]
reached her level, Loewe?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadLoeweAngry]
No, but we're not on even[N]
ground, are we? Look around.[AN]
The Cythean bastards that you[N]
threw everything away for?[AN]
They're dead on the ground,[N]
and us Liberators still stand.[AN]
Even if I fail, I've got them[N]
to rely on[Beat] But I won't.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
[Beat]Confident, or foolish?[N]
Which are you, I wonder?[A][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadLoeweAngry]
Let's find out, Cidor![AN]
Dragana, are you watching?[N]
I'll avenge you, here and now![A][X]

## Ch10CidorMiraBQ
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
Mira, I[Beat][A][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadMira]
You've got something to say?[N]
Don't waste your breath.[AN]
The moment that you killed[N]
Kasun[Beat] No, earlier, really.[AN]
When you decided to hand over[N]
Decia to Cythean invaders,[AN]
there was nothing more for[N]
the two of us to say.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
[Beat]I understand that, Mira.[AN]
And I won't try to convince[N]
you; I know you well enough.[AN]
I just wanted to know[Beat][AN]
Was Iskra happy, with the[N]
life that you gave her?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadMira]
She was. She could've been[N]
a duchess, and maybe[Beat][AN]
Maybe she would've been[N]
happier with that life.[AN]
But with the Liberators,[AN]
she had everything that[N]
she needed[Beat] A family.[AN]
Of all the things I regret[Beat][AN]
Taking her with me isn't[N]
one of those, Cidor.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]I see. I'm happy to hear[N]
that, despite everything.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadMira]

reminiscing for one day.[AN]
For Kasun, I'll finish this![A][X]

## Ch10CidorIskraBQ
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
[Beat]You are barely more than[N]
a child, girl. Turn back.[AN]
You are not my enemy[Beat][N]
We have no need to fight.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadIskra]
I may not be your enemy,[N]
but you sure are mine![AN]
You killed General Dragana[Beat][AN]
She was like an aunt to me,[N]
and you murdered her![AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
An aunt, hm? I apologize,[N]
but I saw no other way.[AN]
I never worried that the[N]
Liberators could succeed[Beat][AN]
But so long as Dragana lived,[N]
I knew that they would fight.[AN]
And if they fought, Decian[N]
blood would keep spilling,[AN]
over and over and over[Beat][AN]
But I misjudged Dragana[Beat][N]
I misjudged her successors.[AN]
The bloodshed never stopped,[N]
no matter how much I tried.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadIskra]
[Beat]Why are you making excuses?[AN]
Why do you care what I think[N]
about you? I'm nobody special.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
[Beat]Who knows? Maybe I just[N]
wanted someone to listen.[AN]
Regardless, I can't surrender[N]
and hand Freyse to you all,[AN]
but still, that doesn't mean[N]
that you have to be my killer.[AN]
A young girl doesn't deserve[N]
that weight on her shoulders.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadIskra]
Weight? Bringing General[N]
Dragana justice isn't that.[AN]
Ever since we left those[N]
dungeons, I've wanted this.[AN]
We've all wanted this![AN]
If I walked away now, I could[N]
never look Loewe in the eye[Beat][AN]
I'm a Liberator, Duke Cidor![N]
And I'll make you pay![A][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
She's her own person, now[Beat][N]
Byelen, please forgive me.[CloseEyes][A][X]

## Ch10CidorKorovaiBQ
[MidRight][LoadKorovai]
Heh[Beat] So, Cythes feared[N]
us enough to send you in?[AN]
You're more loyal a dog[N]
than I imagined, duke.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
And you are[Beat] Korovai, hm?[AN]
You bear little resemblance[N]
to the boy I met, back then.[AN]
But I suppose the fools under[N]
your banner wouldn't know[Beat][AN]
That they serve a fraud.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadKorovai]
[Beat]Fraud or not, guess what?[N]
None of it matters, Cidor.[AN]
My Decian countrymen have[N]
placed their faith in me[Beat][AN]
So no matter who I am,[N]
I won't let them down![AN]
The freedom that your choices[N]
robbed all Freysians of[Beat][AN]
I'll take it back myself and[N]

[Beat]You speak as if we are[N]
familiar. Who are you?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight]
Ah, no one important, really.[AN]
Just a mercenary you hired[N]
who found a higher calling.[AN]
You imprisoned a friend[N]
of mine[Beat] Father Svetomir.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft]
Oh, the one causing mayhem[N]
over our Cythean ties[Beat][AN]
Yes, I remember him, now.[N]
And what, you fight for him?[AN]
For some wrong you believe[N]
I've done? Quite uninspired.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight]
Nah. That's how it started,[N]
sure, but it's different now.[AN]
I've got people that count on[N]
me here. People that trust me.[AN]
And[Beat] I saw how they hurt,[N]
when you killed Dragana.[AN]
I didn't know her[Beat] But when[N]
I saw that, I swore an oath.[AN]
That one day, when I was[N]
stronger, I'd make you pay![AN]
Today's that day, Cidor![N]
You die, by my blade![A][X]

## Ch10CidorDelilahBQ
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
A sister of the Byelen faith?[AN]
I have no desire to fight you,[N]
so I suggest you walk away.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadDelilah]
Ooh, scary! What, are you[N]
going to throw me in jail?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
What? Why ask[Beat] Ah, I see.[AN]
You must have participated[N]
in Father Svetomir's protest.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadDelilah]
That's a strong word[Beat][AN]
Let's say that I was dragged[N]
into it by that idiot.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
Then why fight me now?[N]
Are you being forced?[AN]
I assure you, if you lay[N]
down your arms, no harm-[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadDelilah]
Nah, I'm here because I want[N]
to be. Sure, maybe I was[Beat][AN]
Just along for the ride,[N]
at the start of all this.[AN]
I had to stick around with[N]
the Liberators to survive.[AN]
But now[Beat] I hate to say it,[N]
but I actually like it here.[AN]
Ugh, this is so embarrassing[Beat][AN][ToggleSmile]
It's fine, though. You won't[N]
live to tell anyone else![A][X]

## Ch10CidorSvetomirBQ
[MidRight][LoadSvetomir]
You there, Cidor![N]
Do you remember me?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
Mm[Beat] Yes, I do. You're the[N]
meddlesome priest, correct?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadSvetomir]
Ha! I bear that title with[N]
pride. Yes, I am Svetomir![AN]
And I have returned to[N]
punish you for your sins![AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
Another person I was far too[N]
merciful with[Beat] Tell me.[AN]
How does a priest like you[N]
plan to defeat me, exactly?[AN]
Will you pray to Byelen[N]
and leave the rest to fate?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadSvetomir]
Prayers have their place,[N]
but with the Liberators,[AN]
I learned an essential truth.[AN]
One I knew when I bore steel[N]
and forgot when I wore cloth.[AN]
Byelen favors those who[N]
answer their own prayers![AN]
And my prayer, you may ask?[AN]
Ending Cythes's vile grip[N]
over my[Beat] no, our homeland![AN]
To begin this grand work[Beat][N]
Cidor, I start with you![AN][X]

## Ch10JohannaBossQuote
[MidLeft][LoadJohanna]
So you Liberators have made it[N]
this far[Beat] Well done, I suppose.[AN]
I am Johanna, captain of[N]
the Cythean forces here.[AN]
I've longed for a challenge[Beat][N]
Try to amuse me, will you?[A][X]

## Ch10JohannaCleoBossQuote
[MidLeft][LoadJohanna]
[Beat]Hold on a moment.[N]
You couldn't be[Beat] Cleo?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
In the flesh. I would say that[N]
it's a pleasure to see you,[AN]
but under these circumstances,[N]
it wouldn't be from the heart.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadJohanna]
You were supposed to be dead,[N]
but if you're standing here,[AN]
then you're worse than dead.[AN]
How many Cytheans have you[N]
killed since you left, traitor?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
Fewer than the number of[N]
Decians that you've killed.[AN]
Of that, I am certain.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadJohanna]
Speak carefully, Cleo. You[N]
may be the general's sister,[AN]
but even that privilege has[N]
its limits. I'm warning you-[A][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
I appreciate your concern,[AN]
but I'm not the same naive girl[N]
that you remember, captain.[AN]
Deployed here, I saw the truth[Beat][N]
And now, my eyes are open.[AN][LoadCleoAngry]
I will never close them again![A][X]

## Ch10JohannaVargaBossQuote
[MidLeft][LoadJohanna]
Hm.[Beat] You look familiar, sir.[N]
Have we met before?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadVarga]
No, we haven't.[A][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadJohanna]
No, I definitely remember you.[N]
[Beat]Aha! You're Varga, right?[AN]
Sir Leonidas's trusted aide,[N]
General Elias's mentor?[AN]
But[Beat] This makes no sense.[N]
Why are you with the Liber-[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadVarga]
That's none of your business.[AN]
All you need to know is that[N]
we're on opposite sides.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadJohanna]
You always were standoffish[Beat][N]
Fine, have it your way, Varga.[AN]
If you trained General Elias,[AN]
then my expectations are high[Beat][N]
Try not to disappoint me![A][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadVarga]
I'm not the same man as the [N]
one who trained Elias, anymore.[AN]
My sword swing's grown slow[Beat][N]
The armor's heavier each day.[AN]
But if it's to protect her[Beat][N]
Then I won't ever give up![A][X]

## Ch10MifanBQ
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
You didn't expect to see me[N]
again, did you? Hmph[Beat][AN]
I haven't forgotten about[N]
what you did to Shagahn.[AN]
My home is nothing more than[N]
a shell of itself, now.[AN]
I can't turn back time[Beat][AN]
But I can make you pay[N]
for your sins, Liberators![A][X]

## Ch10MifanBuldakBQ
[MidRight][LoadBuldak]
Mi[Beat] You've grown stronger,[AN]
but not strong enough to stop[N]
the Liberators. Please, just-[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
I don't care if I can stop[N]
you and your masters, Buldak.[AN]
But for the people that they[N]
slaughtered in Shagahn[Beat][AN]
I have no choice but to try![AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadBuldak]
Try what? All you'll be doing[N]
is rushing to an early grave.[AN]
How does Shagahn benefit?[AN]
If you let me put a word in,[N]
I can try to keep you alive.[AN]
I can use the money that[N]
they've given me to rebuild-[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
I'd rather die ten times[N]
over than live like you.[AN]
[Beat]Besides, don't you[N]
remember what I said?[AN]
The moment you stood before[N]
me, your fate was sealed.[AN]
[Beat]You want to atone, Buldak?[N]
Then die, right here and now![A][X]

## Ch10MifanValseBQ
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
What happened to you, Valse?[AN]
How could you side with[N]
that band of traitors?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadValse]
Traitors? I know things went[N]
bad back in your village,[AN]
but Lord Korovai and the[N]
rest want a free Freyse.[AN]
Maybe he made some mistakes,[N]
some big ones, but[Beat][AN]
If you'd just talk it out,[N]
I'm sure that you'd see-[A][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
Are you that foolish, Valse?[AN]
Some honied words are all[N]
it took to change your mind?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadValse]
It ain't just that at all.[AN]
Look around, Mifan. We've[N]
got Cytheans egging us on,[AN]
forcing us to fight while[N]
their leaders sit back.[AN]
But Lord Korovai's putting[N]
his life on the line, here.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
That's just[Beat] Who cares?![AN]
That doesn't change what[N]
he's done[Beat] What they've-[A][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadValse]
Maybe, but the Cytheans don't[N]
have clean hands, either.[AN]
So if I gotta trust one of[N]
them to make things right,[AN]
then I'll bet on the man[N]
who cares about Freyse,[AN]
enough to risk everything[N]
just like the rest of us![AN]
We didn't know each other for[N]
long, Mifan, but[Beat] Sorry.[AN]
I've gotta do the right thing![A][X]

## Ch10MifanHornetBQ
[MidRight][LoadHornet]
[Beat]Mifan, things have[N]
changed. Stand down.[AN]
Otherwise, I'll make you.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
Even you've betrayed us?[AN]
I never expected Korovai[N]
to trick you so easily.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadHornet]
There's no trick. I saw an[N]
honest man in Lord Korovai.[AN]
One who's made mistakes.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
Killing innocents wasn't[N]
just a mistake, Hornet.[AN]
It was a choice. One that[N]
he'll make again, I'd bet.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadHornet]
But he hasn't, and if he[N]
tries it, I won't let him.[AN]
[Beat]That makes him better[N]
than the Cytheans, to me.[AN]
Has one village made you[N]
forget what they've done?[A][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
You[Beat] It wasn't just one[N]
village to me, you-[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadHornet]
No, it wasn't. But Freyse[N]
is much bigger than you.[AN]
And Freyse needs leaders[N]
that it can trust, now.[AN]
[Beat]Walk away, Mifan.[N]
I don't want to do this.[A][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
[Beat]You've known me long[N]
enough to know my answer.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadHornet]
[Beat]Yes, I have.[AN][X]

## Ch10MifanKorovaiBQ
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
Korovai[Beat] I've waited[N]
for this moment for so long.[AN]
At last, I'll have my revenge[Beat][A][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadKorovai]
If you want the chance to[N]
take it, I won't deny it.[AN]
But I have something to say[N]
first, if you'll listen.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
[Beat]Make it quick, bastard.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadKorovai]
Nothing I say can bring back[N]
the lives that we took away,[AN]
but believe me when I say[N]
that I never wanted this.[AN]
I never wanted to have to[N]
sacrifice people's lives.[AN]
And I made the wrong choice[N]
in Shagahn. I'll admit it.[AN]
[Beat]So if you want my head,[N]
then you can have it, Mifan.[AN]
As long as you wait until[N]
Castle Freyse falls, that is.[A][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
[Beat]What a waste of my time.[N]
I reject your offer, Korovai.[AN]
I have no reason to wait when[N]
I can kill you right now![A][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadKorovai]
[Beat]If that's what you want,[N]
then I can't stop you, Mifan.[AN]
But here's a warning for you:[AN]
so long as Cythes's chains[N]
bind Freyse's[Beat] no, my people,[AN]
I won't let anyone get in[N]
the way of their freedom![A][X]

## Ch10MifanLoeweBQ
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
You[Beat] Ah, I remember you.[N]
Look, I don't want a fight.[AN]
I only care about taking[N]
down Cidor, nothing else.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
Too bad, because I want[N]
a fight with you, Loewe.[AN]
That's your name, isn't it?[AN]
Leader of the Liberators,[N]
supposed hero to Decia?[AN]
You really don't live up[N]
to that reputation.[AN]
What kind of hero kills[N]
innocent people, huh?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
Innocent? We didn't start that[N]
battle, in case you forgot.[AN]
The moment we dropped anchor[N]
in Shagahn, guess what?[AN]
You and your militia were[N]
already trying to kill us.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]
Don't try to make excuses![AN]
You all acted like Korovai's[N]
dogs, right from the start-[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
Look, I didn't want to kill[N]
any Decians. I still don't.[AN]
But we did what we had to do[N]
to survive, that day. Today?[AN][LoadLoeweAngry]
Today is different. If you'd[N]
support Cidor and Cythes,[AN]
then the past doesn't matter.[N]
You're not my countryman[Beat][AN]
You're just a traitor who[N]
needs an arrow in her head![AN][X]

for the sake of its ambitions?[A]
[FarLeft]
Not a day goes by that I don't lament the[N]
suffering Cythes has caused, but even so,[N]
I cannot waver. Too much is at stake.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
I didn't know Cleo's brother was a[N]
Cythean knight, but she always spoke[N]
highly of you. Yet you're spouting[AN]
this nonsense? If you believe the[N]
reason for Cythes's conquest is beyond[AN]
mere greed, just tell us![A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
General, you can't[Beat][A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
If only I could tell you, but regrettably it must[N]
remain a secret. If this information were to[N]
spread, the consequences would be dire.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
So, where does this leave us? You won't tell[N]
us anything, and you've come with a squad of[N]
dracoknights. Must we truly fight here?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Fortunately, there's no need for that.[AN]
My orders were to assist Duke Cidor,[N]
and considering he can barely stand,[N]
we've no choice but to retreat.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
You think we're going to let him get away?[N]
Cleo's brother or not, I can't let you do this![A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Loewe, I'm sorry. I want to avenge Dragana[N]
as much as you, but this is a fight we can't[N]
win. We're all exhausted from the battle,[AN]
and even if we weren't, Elias is one of the[N]
strongest knights in all of Cythes.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Goodbye, Cleo. I'll pray for your[N]
continued safety.[A]

Dragana[Beat] We were so close.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
We'll get Cidor next time. He's[N]
escaped justice far too long.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Cleo, I think I may have a clue about the[N]
secrets your brother is hiding. Have you[N]
heard of the Forbidden Passages?[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
The Forbidden Passages[Beat][N]
That does sound familiar.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
They're said to be lost to time, but the[N]
late Lord Joakim caught wind of rumors[N]
that Cythes unearthed some of them.[AN]
They're said to speak of great calamity,[N]
and that their secrets may bring Orodreth[N]
salvation, or ruin.[AN]
Of course, all of this is still hearsay.[N]
I've never even met anyone who's read them,[N]
or even confirmed they exist.[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Thank you, Epony. Any clues are helpful[N]
when there's so little we know.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Will you two stay in Freyse, or join us[N]
in liberating the rest of Decia?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
I wish I could help bring down Cidor[N]
for good, but it's time I put Freyse[N]
first for a change.[AN]
Freyse needs a leader, and I need to[N]
make up for my prior failings.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
I'm staying as well, but the rest of[N]
our fighters will remain with you.[AN]
After all, the liberation of Decia[N]
is in Freyse's best interest.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Thanks, we won't disappoint.[A]

So they know about the Forbidden[N]
Passages[Beat][AN]
Cleo, Loewe, I pray you do not[N]
dig any deeper, for your sakes.[AN]
No, for the sake of all Orodreth[Beat][A]

Excuse me, I believe I'm supposed[N]
to give this to you.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
A sword? Where'd you get this?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
A strange man told me to give[N]
this to the blonde mage if[N]
Duke Cidor was defeated.[A]

How strange[Beat][A][X]
