Thanks be Byelen, whom has blessed us.[AN]
Thou who hast granted us water to drink,[N]
whom hast given us food to grow, [AN]

thou to whom we art eternally grateful.[AN][OpenEyes]

Well said.[AN]

May we begin eating, Father?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Before we do, Cidor,[AN]
I'm about about to tell you[N]
the most important lesson of your life;[AN]
the one that all your training and[N]
education has led up to.[AN]
If you remember nothing else,[N]
remember what I am about to tell you.[AN]
Are you ready?[AN]
[MidRight]
Y-yes Father, I'm ready.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Our sole purpose in life is[N]
for the sake of our people.[AN]
We wield influence and power[N]
that decide who lives and dies.[AN]
We can do what no one else can.[N]
We wield vicious might.[AN]
And it must be used for[N]
the good of all.[AN]
Should you forget this[Beat][AN]
Everything will have[N]
been for naught.[AN]
All your lessons, your education.[AN]
The triumphs and sacrifices of[N]
our ancestors before us.[AN]
Byelen's bountiful miracles[N]
unto the world.[AN]
Our very lives.[AN]
All of it.[AN]
All of it will[N]
have been in vain.[AN]

It's quite amazing what people[N]
will reveal after a couple[N]
glasses of wine.[AN]
One of the captains stationed[N]
here from Cythes had passed[N]
it along to me.[AN]
She had found it in her travels,[N]
taken from the clutches of an[N]
[OpenQuote]irresponsible runaway princess".[AN]
She wished to have me relay it to[N]
General Argymos, presumably because[N]
of his connection to the Lorekeepers.[AN]

[OpenQuote]Ritual sacrifice" would[N]
be more accurate,[AN]

Cidor plans to slaughter his[N]
wealth of prisoners tonight.[AN]
[Left]
Why?![AN]
[MidRight]
I admit that the specifics escape me,[AN]
I could only overhear for a few moments[N]
after Cidor had Kwame taken away,[AN]
but as I said, he believes that[N]
he is performing a [OpenQuote]ritual".[AN]
One that he believes would have[N]
the power to [OpenQuote]single-handedly save Decia".[AN]

Save Decia?![A] That bastard![AN]
He's sent so many people to their[N]
deaths and he thinks he's saving Decia?![AN]

who is just trying to mess with us![AN]

It was but a jest; your suspicions[N]
are nothing but rational![AN]
As a token of good faith, I shall[N]
reveal a bit about myself and Kwame.[AN]
[Left][LoadLoewe]
Go on.[AN]
[MidRight]
Kwame is a scholar of history,[N]
and I but his humble student.[AN]
A student of history, and a[N]
little birdie that whispers[AN]
information into his ear[N]
from time to time.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Kwame has spies?[AN]
[MidRight]
That is a less than wholesome word,[AN]
and I can't attest to whether he[N]
actually employs others like me,[AN]
but yes, that would describe what[N]
I do for him.[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat][AN]
[ThreeLineBox]
[MidRight]
You don't think that your meeting[N]
with him in Port Neufchatel[N]
was a coincidence, do you?[AN]
You stirred up quite the storm[N]
in the keep of [OpenQuote]my good lord Cidor"[N]
a few months ago.[AN]
Kwame had been looking for an[N]
opportunity to disrupt Cythes's[N]
opperations in Decia,[AN]
and your group seemed[N]
like one who finally had[N]
the mettle to do so.[AN]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Port Neufchatel[Beat][AN]
I suppose Cidor wouldn't[N]
have any way to know[AN]
that we met Kwame there[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
How astute![AN]
And even if you didn't[N]
believe me,[AN]
Castle Selese is but a short[N]
distance away at this point.[AN]
You might as well strike[N]
while the iron is hot.[A][X]

Castle Selese was relatively[N]
undermanned and not bolstered[N]
by Cythean troops when I left;[AN]
I've heard that General Elias and[N]
a gaggle of Selese's remaining forces[N]
were stationed in Raio Pass,[AN]
given that it's the main path[N]
into Selese from Castle Freyse.[AN]
Cidor's actions and visit[N]
tonight seem impromptu.[AN]
I don't think they were aware[N]
of your current whereabouts.[AN]
In fact, even I'm quite shocked[N]
that your group even managed to[N]
bypass the pass.[AN]
But I won't question it,[N]
it's only to our advantage.[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I believe you.[AN]
Cleo, this might be our chance![AN]
We can finally purge Cythes[N]
from Decia once and for all.[AN]
I think we should go for it.[AN]
[FarLeft]
I'm concerned, but what he's[N]
told us so far lines up.[AN]
I'm inclined to agree,[AN]
we might not get another[N]
chance like this.[AN]
Let's do it.[AN]
[MidRight]
Wonderful! Let us make haste,[N]
time is of the essence.[AN]
Whether or not there is any merit[AN]
to Cidor's theory that this[N]
ritual will be his salvation,[AN]
it changes nothing;[AN]
he plans to slaughter[N]
countless innocents.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Agreed, Cidor's madness[N]
must come to an end.[AN]
[MidRight]
Let me join you on the battlefield.[N]
I don't like to get my hands dirty,[AN]
