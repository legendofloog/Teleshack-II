## Ch12xTrajanStopsYou
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan][ThreeLineBox]
It seems like you've still got[N]
some choices to make, Loewe.[N]
Talk to me when you're done.[A][X]

## Ch12xTrajanConfirmation1
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
Looks like you've selected some[N]
fine people. You ready to head out?[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove](Am I?)[ToggleMouthMove][No][X]

## Ch12xTrajanRejection
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
Oh? Well, don't take too long.[N]
Wouldn't want to keep Korovai waiting.[A][X]

## Ch12xRecruitedTwoUnits
[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
That's all sorted, then.[N]
My business here is done.[A][X]

## Ch12CleoNightmare1
[MidRight][LoadCleo][MidBlink][ThreeLineBox]
Huh? Where[Beat] Where am I?[AN]
Actually, how did I even get here?[N]
I could've swore I was with[N]
Loewe only a moment ago[Beat] Hmm.[AN][OpenEyes]
Well, nothing for it but to look[N]
around[Beat] is what I would say,[N]
but I can't see a thing in this fog.[AN]
I suppose I'll have to move carefully.[A][X]

## Ch12CleoNightmare2
[MidRight][LoadCleo][ThreeLineBox]
Hm, even without the fog, I can[N]
scarcely see a thing out here.[AN]
Perhaps there[Beat] isn't anything?[AN]
I can't imagine where such a void[N]
would exist but a dream[Beat][N]
It's so quiet, too. Almost peaceful.[AN]
What I wouldn't do for just a bit[N]
of this silence these days[Beat][A][X]

## Ch12CleoNightmare3
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x6D][0x1]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
Hm? There's someone else here?[AN]
Excuse me, sir, but do you[N]
know where we are right now?[AN]
If you have any idea, we may be able[N]
to use that information and escape.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Escape? There is no escape.[N]
Not for me[Beat] or for you, wretch.[A]
[Event]
[MidRight][MidBlink][ThreeLineBox]
Huh? Those houses[Beat][N]
How did they get here?[AN]
And this[Beat] is this blood?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Don't act like you forgot, Cythean.[AN]
Decians will not forgive[Beat][N]
and we will never forget.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadCleoSad]
I[Beat] I made the wrong choices,[N]
but I'm doing everything I can[N]
to try and make things right.[AN]
What more[Beat] What more can I do?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Your crimes will never wash away,[N]
no matter how you try to atone.[AN]
All that can satisfy us[Beat][N]
is vengeance for our deaths.[N]
Starting[Beat] with[Beat] you[Beat][AN][X]

## Ch12CleoNightmare4
[MidRight][LoadCleoSad]
He[Beat] He's gone?[CloseEyes] I[Beat] I remember him[N]
now. I never thought I'd see him again[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]
No, I can't dwell on the past now.[N]
I have to escape this place![AN][X]


## Ch12CleoNightmare5
[MidLeft][Load23RedSoldier]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
Another one? Wait, you're[Beat][N]
Alric? Is that you?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Aye. I thought you'd forgotten me,[N]
and everyone else in the platoon.[AN]
That sniper had us dead to rights[Beat][N]
but here you stand, still alive and[N]
following in that woman's footsteps.[AN]
Was it worth betraying your comrades?[AN]
[MidRight][LoadCleoAngry]
Betrayal? Is that how you see it?[N]
We were in the wrong, Alric![AN]
Couldn't you see that?[AN][LoadCleoSad]
Couldn't you see the blood we spilled,[N]
all for the sake of our own lives?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Those Decians would have done the same[N]
if it with their fields rotting,[N]
if it were their livestock diseased.[AN]
Is it wrong to fight for survival?[AN]
[Beat]Not that any of it matters now.[N]
Your [OpenQuote]free" Decia comes at the cost of[N]
who knows how many Cythean lives.[AN]
I hope that you're happy[Beat] traitor.[A][X]

## Ch12CleoNightmare6
[MidRight][LoadCleoAngry][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Whether they'd do it or not is[N]
irrelevant. Killing innocents[N]
for your own gain is unjustifiable![AN]
If that makes me a traitor, then[N]
I'll wear that title with pride.[AN][LoadCleo]
There has to be a way to save Cythes,[N]
too. There[Beat] There must be![A][X]

## Ch12CleoNightmare7
[FarLeft][LoadLeonidas]
[Left][LoadElias]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
Father? Elias?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Oh, my foolish, foolish, daughter.[N]
Where did I fail in raising you?[AN]
We are the emperor's sword and shield[Beat][N]
And now, you dare raise that sword[N]
to his neck? Why[Beat] Why, Cleo?[AN]
Why must you disappoint me so?[AN]
[MidRight][LoadCleoAngry]
I'm only following what you told me![AN]
To do the right thing, no matter what![AN]
Isn't that what you spent hours upon[N]
hours trying to impress on me?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Yes, but it appears you forgot the most[N]
important part. Our emperor, more than[N]
anyone, knows what is and isn't right.[AN]
You may think your deeds righteous,[N]
but Orfeas ordered Decia's conquest,[N]
and all of Orodreth's, for good cause.[AN]
To oppose that is spitting on his name,[N]
discarding all that you have ever been[N]
and all who have ever cared for you.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadCleoSad][CloseEyes][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat] I only wanted[Beat][N]
To make you both proud[Beat][AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Come home, Cleo. There's still time[N]
to undo your mistakes. I understand why[N]
you did what you did, but even so[Beat][AN]
Do you really want to face us in battle?[AN]
I don't want to cut down my own sister[Beat][N]
Make the right choice, Cleo. Please.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadCleo][OpenEyes][OneLineBox]
[Beat]No, Elias.[A] I can't.[A][X]

## Ch12CleoNightmare8
[MidRight][LoadCleoAngry][ThreeLineBox]
Orfeas is just a man[Beat] One who's[N]
stained his throne with rivers of blood.[AN]
I won't swear fealty to him like you![A][X]

## Ch12CleoNightmare9
[MidRight][LoadCleo][MidBlink]
Damn[Beat] Will this fog never let up?[AN]
There has to be a way out somewhere,[N]
but I still can't see a thing.[AN]
Is someone out there? Anyone?![A][Event]
[FarFarLeft][LoadLoewe]
Cleo?[A]
[MidRight]
Someone[Beat] is calling me[Beat]?[AN]
[FarFarLeft]
Come on, Cleo![N]
We've got work to do![AN]
[MidRight]
Hold on, I'm coming![N]
Don't leave me behind![A][X]

## Ch12xBeginningScene2
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft]
Hello, Cleo? Anyone home?[N]
I'd rather not pull a one-man watch.[A]
[MidRight]
W-What?[N]
Loewe, is that you?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Huh? Are you low on sleep or something?[N]
It's not like you to be so distracted.[AN]
[MidRight]
No, I just[Beat] was lost in thought.[N]
My apologies, truly.[AN]
[MidLeft]
We can't afford to lose focus until[N]
we know this castle inside and out.[AN]
If we let our guard down during patrols,[N]
there's no telling who might ambush us.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Yes, of course[Beat] Say, Loewe. Do you[N]
remember our pact at the island?[AN]
With Cidor defeated, Decia is free,[N]
so the conditions are now met.[AN]
Well, you can likely guess much[N]
of my story, given Elias's appearance,[N]
but I still want to know yours.[A]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
Ah, right[Beat][OpenEyes] I'd almost forgotten.[N]
I'll tell you mine first, but I still[N]
want an actual explanation from you.[AN]
[Beat]I was born in Mahemen soon before[N]
the Cythean invasion, so I don't[N]
remember much of my time there.[AN]
When Cythes's march reached Wustheim,[N]
my parents took me and fled to Decia,[N]
leaving the city as it burned to ashes.[AN]
[MidRight]
You lived in the former capital[N]
of Mahemen, then[Beat][N]
What happened to your parents?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Nothing, for a time. Mahemen fought[N]
back hard, but years later, Cythes[N]
gave in and set their sights on Decia.[AN]
The dogs still gave a token effort[N]
in Mahemen, but the majority of their[N]
forces focused on the new campaign.[AN]
My family settled close to Selese[N]
territory, so when Cidor let Cythes[N]
in unhindered, and our town resisted[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]You need not say anymore, Loewe.[N]
Thank you for telling me this story,[N]
painful though it may be.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
A deal's a deal. Now, it's time[N]
for your side of the bargain.[AN]
How did someone from the Argymos[N]
family end up on this side?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Ha, an interesting question[Beat][ToggleSmile][N]
In many respects, it is because[N]
of my family that I am here.[AN]
I enrolled in the Gechrysos Military[N]
Academy with them in mind, wanting[N]
to aid my country and honor my family.[AN]
I and my peers believed that our service[N]
could bring our country back to its[N]
former glory and save it from famine,[AN]
but when we graduated and finally took[N]
to the field, everything changed.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
You couldn't handle the[N]
reality of what it'd cost.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox][LoadCleoSad]
We didn't understand the true nature[N]
of war. Many of my comrades died[N]
quickly, with their hands clean of sin,[AN]
but others turned into people[N]
I could scarcely recognize[Beat][AN]
As for me, I contemplated desertion,[N]
but I continued to follow my orders.[AN]
It was all that I ever knew.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Until you met Dragana.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox][LoadCleo]
Yes, I would have died a shell of my[N]
former self had she not granted me[N]
mercy that day. That's why[Beat][AN][ToggleSmile]
I am relieved that we saw her will[N]
through. It feels as if I have repaid[N]
her faith in me, if only a little.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I'm sure that she can rest easy too,[N]
knowing Decia is finally free.[ToggleSmile] Still,[N]
that doesn't mean our work is done.[AN]
Cythes still stands, and we know[N]
nothing of that foul spell that[N]
took Dragana's body as a host.[A]
[MidRight]
Right. That Lost Ritual[Beat] It clearly[N]
is tied to the legendary weapons.[N]
If we mean to learn more about them,[AN]
Mahemen should be our next destination.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Agreed. Cythes is no doubt headed there[N]
after we sent them packing, and we can't[N]
let them take Mahemen without a fight.[AN]
Besides, my mother's sword seems linked[N]
to the weapons, and if I'm right, then[N]
we have even more reason to go there.[AN]
The Mahemeni would no doubt know more[N]
about it than most anyone else,[N]
and we need all the info we can get.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Then let's chart out a plan. Perhaps[N]
we should recruit a few more- hm?[A][X]


## Ch12xBeginningScene3
[MidLeft][LoadTao]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Halt! Who- wait, a civilian?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
A-ah, sorry for bothering you,[N]
sir and miss. I wasn't eavesdropping[N]
or anything, I swear! Honest![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Ha, I wouldn't care if you were,[N]
unless you're a secret Cythean spy.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
N-No! I'm not, really![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Then what's your reason for[N]
wandering around the castle?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I'm looking for my cousin.[N]
We were together, but I got lost.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Hm? You two refugees or something?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Yeah[Beat] Our family's all gone,[N]
so we're all we have left.[N]
Can you help me, sir?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Sure, I don't mind.[N]
Where'd you see her last?[A]
[MidLeft]
In the garden, towards the[N]
center of the castle.[A]
[MidRight]
Oh, that's towards the courtyard.[N]
Let's look around there, alright?[A][X]

## Ch12xBeginningScene3Part2
[MidLeft][LoadTao]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]

Dang it[Beat] my aim was all off.[N]
Well, I won't miss your vitals again.[A]
[Right]
Aaagh! My eye[Beat][N]
Don't think you'll get away with this![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Be quiet, monster! Don't you remember[N]
what you did? You killed my cousin,[N]
Mifan! This is the justice you deserve![AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Mifan? That loud swordswoman?[N]
But she[Beat] they were turncoats[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Lies! Their only crime was not giving[N]
in to a noble rat's demands for food![AN]
None of them had to die[Beat][N]
This is all your fault![AN]

I have to avenge Mi![N]
I have to- Mmgh![A]

That's enough talk out of you. Svetomir,[N]
please heal Loewe immediately![N]
He could bleed out at this rate.[AN][MidRight][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

At once, commander! I can save him from[N]
death, but his eyesight is irreparable.[N]
That is, er, he may find it difficult to-[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Just do it, Svetomir! We don't[N]
have time to waste on explanations![AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Yes, ma'am! Commander Loewe, you'll[N]
need to rest after this, I'm sure.[N]
Let us return to your quarters.[AN]

you'll need to rest after this.[N]
Let us return to your quarters.[AN]

[Beat]Fine. I'll leave this to you, Cleo.[AN][X]

## Ch12xBeginningScene4Part3BuldakAlive
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
Now, as for the boy[Beat][N]
Buldak? What do you want?[A]
[MidRight][LoadBuldak]
Please, don't kill him![N]
Tao's not lying about this.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Who do you take me for? I'll not harm[N]
a civilian, but I have no qualms with[N]
hurting you if you don't elaborate.[A]
[MidRight]
The truth is[Beat] the truth is that[N]
Korovai deceived you. Those[N]
villagers we fought in Freyse[Beat][AN]
they weren't on the side of Cythes.[N]
Just for some damned rice, Epony and[N]
Iberis used you to take it from them.[AN]
Tao was staying in a neighboring town,[N]
so he survived[Beat] but he must have[N]
come back and saw the village's remains.[AN]
I saw him earlier and tried to find[N]
him before he did something like this,[N]
but it seems I was too late, commander.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox][LoadCleoAngry]
[Beat]Explain why you chose not to[N]
tell us this detail, quickly.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
We had too many other allies watching[N]
my every move. Iberis and Epony told me[N]
that if I considered revealing it,[AN]
they would have me killed, and I had[N]
no idea what they were planning until[N]
it was too late. And now[Beat] Mi's gone.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Then I will give you a choice. Die[N]
here as their collaborator, or work[N]
for us. If you wish to atone for this,[AN]
the choice should be clear, Buldak.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Whatever you need, I'll do it.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox][LoadCleo]
Good. For now, we should give Tao over[N]
to Trajan and let him watch the boy.[N]
After that, let us make our own plans.[AN][LoadCleoAngry]
I will not let this injustice stand[Beat][AN][X]

## Ch12xBeginningScene4Part3BuldakGone
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
Now, as for the boy[Beat][N]
Lieutenant? What do you want?[A]
[MidRight][LoadFace][0x71][0x1][ThreeLineBox]
Er[Beat] We found something out about[N]
a village in Freyse. This boy[Beat][N]
Do you mean to kill him, commander?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Who do you take me for?[N]
I'll not harm a civilian.[N]
Is this information truly so important?[AN]
[MidRight]
It seems that the village of militia[N]
the Liberators destroyed when they[N]
first met up with Lady Iberis was[Beat][AN]
Well, it was all a plot by Lord[N]
Korovai, Epony, and Iberis.[AN]
The people there weren't on Cythes's[N]
side, but they wouldn't give over[N]
their supplies to Korovai's army.[AN]
They used us to do their dirty work.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I[Beat] You're certain about this?[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Yes, commander. There is no doubt.[A]
[MidLeft][LoadCleoAngry][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]They're going to regret this,[N]
lieutenant. Mark my words, they will.[AN]
But for now, we should give Tao over[N]
to Trajan and let him watch the boy.[N]
After that, let us make our own plans.[AN][LoadCleoAngry]
I will not let this injustice stand[Beat][AN][X]

## Ch12xBeginningScene5
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
Sorry I'm late, Trajan.[N]
Didn't mean to keep you waiting.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Don't worry about it, Loewe. More[N]
importantly, how are you holding up?[N]
I haven't seen you since[Beat] you know.[AN]
[MidRight]
Shooting my bow is more awkward than[N]
it used to be, but I'm still breathing.[N]
Can't ask for much more than that, yeah?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I guess so. Tao cooled down once he[N]
found out about the circumstances[Beat][N]
So Lord Joakim's son tricked you two?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]That's right. Korovai and Epony used[N]
us to do their dirty work. All those[N]
whispers about what we were doing[Beat][AN]
I finally get it. Just thinking about[N]
how smug those two must feel for pulling[N]
one over on us makes my blood boil.[AN]
[MidLeft]
For now, try to hide it. We can't[N]
have you flying off the handle[N]
during our meeting with them tonight.[AN]
Decia's seen enough conflict, and[N]
there'll be plenty of time to figure[N]
out what to do about them later.[AN]
[MidRight]
Don't worry about me. I'll keep it[N]
under wraps, for now. That being said,[N]
let's get to our other business.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Mm. You and Cleo are[N]
headed to Mahemen, right?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Yeah. We're not liberating Decia[N]
anymore, but Cythes conquering[N]
Mahemen would be bad news for us all.[AN]
Do you have the recruits assembled?[A]
[MidLeft]
A few are waiting in the other room.[N]
You can take two of them, but the[N]
rest will stay here to help out.[AN]
We got a lot of applicants once Cidor[N]
was defeated, but we'll need 'em all[N]
to recover from the occupation.[AN]
After liberation comes restoration, eh?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
True enough[Beat] Hm,[N]
where are Cleo and Kwame?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
She didn't tell you where she went?[N]
Cleo said that she's handling[N]
some logistics for your trip,[AN]
and Kwame is assisting her there.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I see. Then I guess I'll choose[N]
them myself. Let's hope some[N]
of them are up for the task[Beat][A][X]

Don't worry so much. No matter what,[N]
I know you and Cleo can handle it.[AN]
That's why Dragana chose you two[N]
as her successors. Isn't that right?[A]
[MidRight]
I wonder. That kid, Tao[Beat] It's our[N]

We were so preoccupied with victory[N]
that we were blind to House Freyse's[N]

[MidLeft]
[Beat]It's not all your fault, Loewe.[AN]
I didn't think they would stoop this low,[N]

At least while I'm here overseeing Selese.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Thanks. Do you plan on giving over[N]
this land to House Freyse, eventually?[N]
Dastard or no, Korovai is still a noble.[AN]
[MidLeft]
After finding out what they've done?[N]
Not a chance. I was their knight once,[N]
but I left Joakim's service for a reason.[AN]
The old ways are done. We can't rely on[N]
nobles to do what's best for the people.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]You're right. With the Cytheans gone,[N]
we finally have a chance to change Decia.[N]
The people should have a say in who,[AN]
if anyone, rules over them.[A]
[MidLeft]
And that's what I'll make sure of.[N]
[Beat]One more thing. With Dragana avenged,[N]
will you still fight for vengeance's sake?[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]No. Cidor may be dead, but Cythes[N]
still lives. For my parents, and my[N]

not until Cythes crumbles at our feet.[A]

And what then? When their armies[N]

Be careful with your vengeance, Loewe.[N]

It seems the Liberators succeeded[Beat][N]

Cythes would stand little chance[N]
against all of us, working as one.[A]
[MidRight]
Perhaps, but there's no telling what[N]
the Liberators may do. We can't remain[N]

Regardless, that's what we brought[N]
our guardsmen for. If the meeting goes[N]

That's how you've survived this long.[AN]
