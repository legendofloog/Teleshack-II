[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Hey, you![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Huh? What business do you[N]
have with me, sir?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Your bow arm is uncertain.[N]
You have no stake in this[N]
fight, don't you?[A]
[MidLeft]
They forced me into this,[N]
or else they'd torch[N]
the village.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
No, they wouldn't[Beat][AN]
I won't let Cythes inflict[N]
my same pain on you.[AN]
We'll chase them outta here,[N]
don't worry, miss.[A]
[MidLeft]
Wait, if you're gonna have[N]
our backs,[AN]
then I'll sign up with[N]
you as well.[AN]
[MidRight]
Then we welcome you with[N]
open arms.[A]
[MidLeft]
By the way, the name's[N]
Darby.[A]
[MidRight]
Nice to meet you, Darby.[A]
Let's get going.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Looks like his home[N]
wasn't so lucky[Beat][AN]
Poor lad[Beat][A][X]

[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft]
Dead!?[AN]
The prisoners killed[N]
Radnitz!?[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes[Beat][AN]
It seems they must've[N]
broken out and[AN]
overwhelmed the[N]
guards on duty.[AN]
They must've planned this[N]
for a while.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ugh, damn it all.[AN]
What of his remaining[N]
forces?[AN]
[MidRight]
Most of them seem to be[N]
willing to work with us.[AN]
We should still be able to hold[N]
our own in Mahemen.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's good.[AN]
Radnitz's death was a great[N]
tragedy,[AN]
but we can still pull this[N]
off.[AN]
[MidRight]
I have faith in us.[AN]
We've been preparing to[N]
go to port,[AN]
to find a ship to Mahemen.[AN]
You should check to see[N]
if you need anything.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I see[Beat][N]
I'll get ready, then.[AN]
[MidRight]
How's your eye doing,[N]
Loewe?[AN]
[MidLeft]
There's minor pain sometimes,[AN]
but it's been doing[N]
fine, mostly.[AN]
[MidRight]
How fortunate.[AN]
I'll see you later,[N]
then.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You too, Cleo.[AN]
[MidRight]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Hmm[Beat][AN]
She seems off.[AN]
But these past few[N]
days have been heavy.[AN]
I pray she's doing alright.[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[MidLeft]
What in the[Beat][AN]
I thought Cythes had[N]
given up on Decia.[AN]
But there's soldiers[N]
all over the place![AN]
[MidRight]
Then we'll have to take[N]
care of them.[AN]
No doubt that they're keeping[N]
any ships to Mahemen from leaving,[AN]
and without Radnitz backing us up[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
We'll be fine, Loewe.[N]
Let's get ready for battle.[A][X]

Huff[Beat][AN]
You must be the[N]
Decian Liberators[Beat][AN]
Please, I need your[N]
help![AN]
[Right]
That garb[Beat][AN]
You're one of Mahemen's[N]
archbishops![AN]
What are you doing all[N]
the way in Decia?[AN]
[FarRight]
The Cytheans are mobilizing.[N]
We can talk later, Archbishop.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I can help you, I know[N]
how to use staves.[AN]
[Right]
Just stay safe, alright.[AN]
We don't want another major[N]
leader dying on our watch.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Thank you, sir![A][X]

## KailaniInfo
Kailani is a temporary unit[N]
and will leave your party[N]
after the chapter.[AN]
Any items in her inventory[N]
will be sent to the convoy[N]
after the battle.[A][X]

## VeniaminBossQ
[MidLeft][LoadVeniamin]
You are harboring a wanted[N]
target of the Cythean Empire.[AN]
Hand her over, and we can[N]
end this, no violence needed.[A][X]

## VeniaminCleoBossQ
[MidLeft][LoadVeniamin]
That hair[Beat][N]
Those eyes[Beat][AN]
You must be the missing[N]
Argymos child.[AN]
Oh ho ho ho, capturing you will[N]
net me a promotion for sure![AN]
Maybe I'll even get a spot[N]
in the Knights of Iris![A][X]

## CorundumBossQ
[MidLeft][LoadCorundum]
The fallen Freysians roll[N]
in their grave[AN]
knowing that allies of[N]
the traitorous Radnitz[AN]
still roam these lands.[AN]
I, Corundum, swear to[N]
avenge them![A][X]

## PascalBossQ
[MidLeft][LoadPascal]
This place, it's just[N]
collateral damage.[AN]
Leave me be, I've got[N]
work to do![A][X]


## VeniaminWarning
[MidLeft][LoadVeniamin]
Enough of this nonsense,[N]
time to pick up the pace.[AN]
I'm going in![A][X]

[Right][LoadLoewePunished]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[FarRight]
That's all taken care[N]
of, now we need answers.[AN]
Why are you in[N]
Decia, Archbishop?[AN]
I thought things were[N]
going well in Mahemen.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's the issue[Beat][N]
Things got way worse.[AN]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Wait, what happened?[N]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Cythes bolstered their[N]
forces in Mahemen tenfold.[AN]
In spite of our knowledge[N]
of how to utilize[AN]
the sands, we couldn't[N]
deal with their numbers.[AN]
[Right]
What of the other[N]
archbishops?[AN]
What of Mahemen's[N]
legendary lance?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I-I don't know.[AN]
Both the other[N]
archbishops and the rebels[AN]
sent me to find aid[N]
in the mainland.[AN]
I don't know anything[N]
else beyond that.[AN]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
As it turns out, we were[N]
also trying to make an[N]
alliance with you.[AN]
We'll help you with[N]
whatever you need,[N]
as long as you back us up.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thank you, Liberators.[AN]
I'm sure Byelen will look[N]
upon all of you favorably[N]
for these heroic deeds.[AN]
And I swear upon my faith[N]
that I will aid you[N]
in any way you feel necessary.[AN][X]

We've lost Decia to the[N]
forces of Freyse and the Liberators[Beat][AN]
What do we do now,[N]
my emperor?[AN]
[MidLeft]
It'd be too costly to invest[N]
more into trying to reclaim Decia.[AN]
I'm assigning you and the Knights[N]
of Iris to Mahemen.[AN]
[MidRight]
Mahemen? But we've struggled[N]
there thanks to the terrain.[AN]
[MidLeft]
And what is a little sand to[N]
Cythes's finest knight?[AN]
I've assigned you to this[N]
task because I have faith in you.[AN]
[MidRight]
I see.[AN]
Thank you for your[N]
confidence, emperor.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Also, Coralia will be coming[N]
with you.[AN]
She wishes to further her studies[N]
by seeing what the capital's library[AN]
has to offer.[AN]
Fortunately, the library was spared[N]
from the carnage all those years ago.[AN]
I have confidence you'll[N]
keep her safe.[AN]
[MidRight]
That's good news.[AN]
I shall prepare my men[N]
for departure.[AN]
Farewell, emperor.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
The day of Cythes's triumph[N]
grows closer and closer.[AN]
Or at least that's what I[N]
want to think[Beat][AN]
I pray it's not too late[N]
to stop the cataclysm[Beat][A][X]

Turns out using a fiery[N]
blade to cook isn't a great idea.[AN]
Take it, I never wanna see that[N]
waste of money again![A][X]

## GreatbowVillageText
[MidLeft][LoadMan1]
[MidRight][LoadActive]
[MidLeft]
This bow is REALLY heavy,[N]
too big for me.[AN]
Maybe one of your allies[N]
will have some use for it.[A][X]

Ah, finally, a hero arrives.[AN]
I'm sure you've heard[N]
of me, the majestic Jacinth.[AN]
My skills will dazzle your[N]
army and push you to beat Cythes![AN]
Let me show you what my[N]
dance can do![A][X]
