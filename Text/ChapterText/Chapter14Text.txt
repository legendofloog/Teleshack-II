## Ch14Opening
With Kwame's ancient wisdom[N]
and Archbishop Kailani's[N]
dire warnings at hand,[AN]
Loewe and Cleo venture forth[N]
unto the desert of Mahemen...[N]
Loewe's ancestral home.[AN]
Accompanied across the waves[N]
by the mightiest warriors[N]
Trajan had to offer,[AN]
long days at sea are whiled[N]
away with meditations[N]
on what lies ahead...[AN]
and fear at what[N]
could come to pass.[A][X]

## Ch14_OnBoat
[FarLeft][LoadLoewePunished]
[OpenFarLeft]
[CloseEyes]Just on the horizon[Beat][N]
the golden sands of Mahemen.[AN]
[Beat]My ancestral home.[AN]
The few memories I have[N]
of it are long dead[Beat][AN]
burned, with my parents[N]
and our home in Wustheim.[AN]
[Beat]With Dragana.[AN]
Is there any welcome I[N]
will recieve as I return?[AN]
Or am I free to forge my own[N]
path, one tempered by Cythean blood?[A]

[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, you must be seeing[N]
the Holy City Telyada![N]
[ToggleSmile]What a wonderful vista it is.[AN]
[CloseEyes]To see the spires of[N]
the Basilica of Saint Eitha[N]
arise above the waves,[AN]
the sunrise light pour down the[N]
cliffs like an iridescent rain[Beat][A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Saint Eitha?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
[OpenEyes]Ah, I almost forgot myself.[AN]
The branch of Byelenism[N]
that you Decians practice[N]
barely mentions the Five Saints.[AN]
All that does is[N]
invite divine wrath,[N]
if you ask me, but[Beat][A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Perhaps you have[N]
a point, Archbishop.[AN]
This Cythean invasion has been[N]
wrath enough for all of us.[A]
[Left]
It looks like we'll reach[N]
the city docks by this evening.[AN]
They're fortified[N]
and lined with men[Beat][AN]
Your Mahemeni rebels must[N]
fear a naval assault.[A]
[Right]
Indeed. The Cythean navy[N]
has few peers on Orodreth.[AN]
If the Holy City were to[N]
fall[Beat] all would be lost.[A]
[FarLeft]
[OpenEyes]It won't.[AN]
Not when we're here.[AN]
Not when we can still make Cythes pay[N]
for all the crimes it's committed.[A]
[FarRight][Beat][A]
[Right]
[Beat]I imagine my fellow Archbishops[N]
will appreciate such enthusiasm.[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadLoewePunished]
[OpenLeft]
Archbishop Kailani.[AN]
I've a question for you,[N]
before we reach Mahemen.[A]
[OpenRight]
Ask whatever you wish, child.[A]
[OpenLeft]
The swordmasters of Mahemen[N]
are legendary across Orodreth.[AN]
[Beat]I'd ask if you know any who would[N]
be willing to teach me their arts.[A]
[OpenRight]
I have a dear friend[N]
among the Mahemen rebels,[AN]
a sworn sword to Archbishop Houvaina.[AN]
She calls herself the Grimblade,[AN]
and her bladework is said to[N]
be sharper than a lion's fang.[AN]
[Beat]Why do you ask?[A]
[OpenLeft]
[Beat]My mother counted herself[N]
among the Swordmasters.[AN]
She gave me this mighty[N]
blade, the Kaiserschwert,[AN]
and began my training[Beat][AN]
[CloseEyes]I never finished it.[A]
[OpenRight]
[Beat][CloseEyes]I'm sorry.[AN]
[Beat]With such a tale, I'm sure even[N]
the Grimblade's heart would be moved.[AN]
Ask for her once we[N]
arrive in the Holy City.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Aye. Thank you, Archbishop.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]
The child is of Mahemeni blood[Beat][N]
How did I not realize sooner?[AN]
He almost looks like[Beat][A] her[Beat][A][X]

## Ch14_LongxiaFangaiChat
[Right][LoadFangai]
[Left][LoadLongxia]
[OpenLeft]
Hm.[AN]
In my past voyages to the Holy City,[N]
it's never been this... sparse.[AN]
The bazaar is emptier than a barrel[N]
of spices after you're done with it,[AN]
and almost everyone strong[N]
enough to hold a blade is gone.[AN]
Only beggars and children[N]
rule the streets now.[A]
[OpenRight]
The bazaar is empty...[N]
What a shame.[AN]
Where will we taste the[N]
fine desert foods now?[AN]
I heard about this incredible[N]
meal made of sliced fish[AN]
covered in salt, nuts,[N]
and fine sauces[Beat][AN]
[OpenLeft]
Do you ever talk about anything[N]
at all other than food, Fangai?[AN]
This is an army we're[N]
in, not my crew.[AN]
We won't get to try the local[N]
recipes at ports we visit anymore.[AN]
I'm surprised Loewe and Cleo[N]
even let you keep cooking.[A]
[OpenRight]
Not much else to talk about[N]
on long voyages at sea.[AN]
And with regards to my[N]
cooking for the army,[AN]
have you tasted that Kwame[N]
fellow's attempts at stew?[A]
[OpenLeft]
Unfortunately.[A][X]

## Ch14_DelilahChat

[Left][LoadDelilah]
[OpenRight][ThreeLineBox]
The words of Byelen? Hah.[N]
Look where that got my grandson.[AN]
Got himself into a tizzy,[AN]
picked up a sword and joined[N]
the Archbishops and their rebels[N]
for "the good of Mahemen"[Beat][AN]
[CloseEyes]Now he's in a mass grave.[A]
[OpenLeft]
[CloseEyes]My bad for expecting the[N]
residents of the "Holy City"[N]
to be the least bit religious[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]Thank you for your time.[A]
[OpenRight][TwoLineBox][Beat][A][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft]
So the Mahemen church rallies[N]
Byelen's faithful here to war[Beat][AN]
What a strange custom.[AN]
Have these vaunted Archbishops[N]
forgotten His teachings of peace?[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Or maybe Svetomir's gotten to them.[A][X]

[FarLeft][LoadLoewePunished]
[Left][LoadKailani]
[Right][LoadHouvaina]
[FarRight][LoadMureib]
[OpenFarRight]
Archbishop Kailani.[AN]
I knew we made the right choice[N]
trusting in you to reach Decia.[A]
[OpenLeft]
You have my thanks,[N]
Archbishop Mureib.[AN]
It gladdens me to see you and[N]
Houvaina alike yet surviving.[A]
[OpenRight][ThreeLineBox]
Surviving... Kailani, my dear,[N]
I do not know if that well[N]
describes our paltry force.[AN]
But with your new companions,[N]
who are...?[A]
[OpenLeft]
These are Cleo, Loewe, and[N]
Kwame, noble captains in[N]
the Decian Liberators.[AN]
After slaying the imperial[N]
governor of their home,[AN]
they have crossed the seas[N]
to assist us in our war[N]
against Cythean tyranny here.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][TwoLineBox]
If you stand against the[N]
Empire, you're allies of ours.[AN]
[Left][ClearFace]
[Left][LoadCleo]
[Left]
We've questions of our own[N]
to ask of you, Archbishops,[AN]
but they can wait.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Then with the return of Kailani,[N]
let this council of the Archbishops[N]
formally be called to order.[AN]
The Sacred Arrow Rebels[N]
welcome you, Decians.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Archbishop Kailani told[N]
us your situation was dire.[AN]
How, exactly? What shape[N]
are your forces in?[A]
[FarRight]
To put it succintly, I[N]
believe we were betrayed.[A]
[Left]
[Beat][CloseEyes]How vile.[OpenEyes][A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
We don't know who was responsible.[AN]
The chaotic stories survivors tell[N]
speak only of Sacred Arrow soldiers[N]
turning their blades on each other,[AN]
of half a dozen of our captains[N]
disappearing or dying in minutes.[AN]
Any of the fallen could[N]
have been the traitor.[AN]
Our army was broken,[N]
the Augur taken captive,[AN]
and the Holy City has become[N]
our last redoubt against[N]
the Cythean war machine.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Ballistae and knights besiege[N]
our walls almost every day,[AN]
and our few remaining soldiers feel[N]
even their faith in Byelen falter.[A]
[FarLeft]
[CloseEyes]Captains disappearing[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]What happened to the Grimblade?[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
You know of her?[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
The Grimblade[Beat][AN]
[CloseEyes]Her loss strikes dearly into[N]
my heart as well as yours,[AN]
Sir Loewe of Decia.[A]
[FarLeft]
[CloseEyes][Beat][A][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][LoadKailani]
[FarLeft]
[OpenEyes]Houvaina, you're the best[N]
tactician of us three Archbishops.[AN]
Could you handle explaining these[N]
military matters for our guests?[A]
[Right]
[OpenEyes]Of course.[AN]
The key to our survival such far[N]
has been a woman known as the Augur.[A]
[Left]
That's quite the ominous name.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
If she is an omen, Lady Cleo,[N]
it is one of Byelen's blessing[N]
upon the Sacred Arrow Rebels.[AN]
Many among our people claim she[N]
has a gift of divine prophecy.[AN]
The truth of these rumors and[N]
her nature is[Beat] unclear to me,[AN]
but her uncanny knowledge has allowed[N]
us to thwart the Cytheans' schemes[N]
as they stumble through the sands.[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
But to our dismay, she was taken[N]
hostage during the traitor's strike.[AN]
I remember watching as a Cythean[N]
wyvern knight dragged her away -[AN]
for those Imperial dogs' own[N]
nefarious purposes, I'm sure.[AN]
Without her, we are left[N]
paralyzed in this city.[AN]
We have few supplies, and[N]
with their omen of victory gone,[AN]
the Sacred Arrow soldiers throw[N]
down their spears in sorrow.[A]
[Left][ClearFace]
[Left][LoadKwame]
[Left]
So Emperor Orfeas takes[N]
yet more hostages[Beat][AN]
Their governor in Decia[N]
tried much the same thing.[A]
[FarRight]
He did? How[Beat] interesting[Beat][AN]
Wait, is that face[Beat] him?[N]
[Beat]What is he doing here?[A]
[Left]
Hm?[A]
[FarRight]
[Beat]It's nothing.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
With Decian aid, I believe we can[N]
cuse what few tools we have to[N]
rescue the Augur from captivity.[AN]
Such would be the first step[N]
to reclaiming both the[N]
Holy City in Byelen's name,[AN]
and Mahemen as a whole.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Tactics are[Beat] not my forte. I[N]
am an advisor, first and foremost.[AN]
Loewe and Cleo should be[N]
better suited to that task.[A]
[FarRight]
And [OpenQuote]Lord Kwame",[AN]
I believe I would like to[N]
speak to you in private as well.[A]
[FarLeft]
Then perhaps the four of us[N]
will move to a separate meeting.[AN]
I have taken the field once[N]
before alongside these Decians,[AN]
and wish to do so again.[A]
[Right]
Very well. Shall we?[A][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[Left]
This may seem a[N]
conclave of equals,[AN]
but you're clearly the[N]
leader of the three.[AN]
Or at least, you wish to be.[AN]
What's your goal here?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]The orders of Byelen for us[N]
Archbishops, his mortal champions,[N]
is not for you to know.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
The orders of Byelen, you say?[AN]
[Beat]I have my doubts[N]
about such a thing.[AN]
But you're wise in the lore[N]
of Mahemen, Archbishop Mureib.[AN]
Answer me this question,[AN]
and this interrogation[N]
can come to an end for now.[AN]
What is the fate of[N]
the Spear of Mahemen?[A]
[FarRight]
The Titan's Fang, you say?[AN]
[Beat]We do not know, Sir Kwame.[AN]
The tales say it is[N]
lost to time and mischance,[AN]
and nothing has occurred[N]
to me to change that view.[AN]
If you'd seek it out, I[N]
wish you the best of luck.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Very well.[A][ClearFace]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
[CloseEyes]He did not even seem to recognize[N]
my face after all these years[Beat][AN]
[Beat][OpenEyes][OpenQuote]Sir Kwame", is it[N]
now, Athanasius?[AN]
And you still act as though[N]
you're the only one alive[AN]
who remembers that[N]
accursed, ancient era[Beat][A][X]

[Beat]From our wyverns' reports,[N]
the Augur is held in the Cythean[N]
marching camp at Mount Rymek.[AN]
That's not far from[N]
here, thankfully -[AN]
a swift forced march with[N]
good local guides should make[N]
it there in just several hours.[AN]
The camp is settled in for the long[N]
term, with a permanent well dug and[N]
palisades built from sturdy stone,[AN]
and has been collecting tribute from[N]
the surrounding regions for months.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
But this isn't a true[N]
fortress, isn't it?[A]
[FarRight]
Not yet, at any rate. So far,[N]
it has walls, but no inner keep.[AN]
The soldiers reside in tents[N]
and shacks, not vast corridors.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You claimed your troops[N]
are too demoralized to do[N]
the brunt of the fighting.[AN]
But do you have[N]
any siege weaponry?[A]
[Right]
[Beat]Yes. Yes, we do.[AN]
Mahemeni ballisticians and[N]
siege mages are some of[N]
the best on all Orodreth.[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Loewe and I have winged mounts,[AN]
and our soldiers are[N]
both swift and mighty.[AN]
If those siege troops can[N]
provide covering fire,[AN]
we can rush our way[N]
through the camp gates,[AN]
save this Augur of yours,[AN]
and soar away to the[N]
safety of the Holy City.[AN]
[FarLeft]
How will we make sure our trip[N]
back with the Augur is safe?[AN]
[Right]
I will take my personal guard and[N]
keep the way clear for you myself.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Kailani, are you sure-[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
The Augur and the Decians have[N]
sacrificed much for our sakes.[AN]
They must be protected,[N]
even at great cost.[A]

The siege troops can be led by[N]
a sworn arrow of mine, Nahiza.[A]

A bit odd to meet the likes[N]

[Right][LoadHouvaina]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Ahem.[AN]
I don't believe we have the[N]
resources or positioning to[N]
conquer the camp outright.[AN]
But with this plan and Nahiza's[N]
ballista skill, rescuing the[N]
Augur[Beat] should be doable.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]I haven't felt a glimmer[N]
of hope like this one[N]
in a long, long time.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
We will do whatever must be[N]
done to bring Cythes down.[A]
[FarRight]
Aha! I knew I was gonna[N]
love workin' with ye![A]
[Right][ClearFace]
[Right][LoadKailani]

Do forgive Nahiza's[Beat][N]
stranger habits.[AN]

well in the battle to come.[A][X]

already in what will come to pass.[AN]

had hoped to speak with her more.[A]

skilled healers as Kailani, but[N]
we bound the worst of the wounds.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]I imagine she may survive,[N]
but she will never fight again.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat][AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]I still saved her, in the end.[AN]
I was there, with blade in hand.[A]
[FarLeft][Beat][A]
[Left]
It was my sword that did[N]
this, not Dragana's arrows[Beat][AN]
Is that the key?[AN]
If it is, then I must find[N]
the Grimblade once more.[AN]
She will teach me to never[N]
let another I care for die.[A]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Watch yourself, Loewe.[AN]
I don't know what she knows of you,[N]
but she is an enemy of the cause.[AN]
If she challenges that,[N]
she cannot be spared.[AN]
No matter what you[N]
hope to gain from her.[A]
[Left][Beat][A]
[MidRight]
I must see to Kailani and[N]
the Augur once more.[AN]
Take care, Liberators of Decia.[A]
[FarLeft]
We will persevere.[AN]
The traitorous Grimblade[N]
will be brought to justice,[AN]
and Mahemen restored into[N]
the Sacred Arrow's hands.[AN]
[Beat]We swear it.[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadAugur]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I knew that radiance[N]
came from somewhere.[AN]
The Halaka Suhaja shines[N]
like it never has before[N]
in your presence, woman.[AN]
Your power radiates[N]
throughout the Basilica.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I see two paths[N]
you walk, Lord Athan.[A]
[MidLeft]
[CloseEyes]So your visions can see[N]
that name as well[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]Please, call me Kwame.[AN]
I find it suits me[N]
far better these days.[A]
[MidRight]
One of light,[N]
one of darkness.[AN]
One of ruin,[N]
one of preservation.[AN]
One that condemns Cythes, one[N]
that condemns all Orodreth.[AN]
[Beat]Which is which?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]My reasons are my own, Augur.[AN]
If you would permit, I[N]
have a question to ask you.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
That is how it is.[AN]
Nothing but questions,[N]
nothing but demands[AN]
to make any shreds of hope[N]
this blessing gives a mere[N]
tool of schemes and war[Beat][AN]
Speak, Kwame.[A]
[MidLeft]
The stories say you lived as[N]
a common weaver and widow[N]
for much of your life,[AN]
and only came into your[Beat][N]
blessing during a calamitous time.[AN]
When exactly did this[N]
power come about?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
A common morning, perhaps[N]
twenty-five years ago.[AN]
I awoke with the early[N]
sunrise to feed my hound,[AN]
when I bore my first prophecy -[N]
one of brigands assaulting my home.[AN]
When their axes and blazing[N]
brands passed through the town,[AN]
leaving ruin in their wake,[AN]
only I - the coward tucking myself[N]
away in a cellar - was spared.[A]
[MidLeft]
[CloseEyes]Twenty-five years ago[Beat][AN]
So the same time as[Beat][A]
[MidRight][Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
I am beginning to realize a[Beat][N]
grim truth about you, Augur.[AN]
How can this calamity we[N]
all foresee be stopped[Beat]?[A][X]

[FarRight]
Ah, there you are![AN]
Archbishop Mureib wishes[N]
to speak with you two,[AN]
Sir Loewe, Lady Cleo.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
But not me?[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
He very specifically excluded[N]
you. My apologies, Sir Kwame.[A]
[FarLeft]
What are we to discuss?[A]
[FarRight]
Tactics for the Sacred Arrow[N]
Rebellion's next battle, I'm told,[AN]
but I'd wager it's far[N]
more than just that.[AN]
In my decade serving him,[N]
he's gotten like this often.[AN]
A single meeting for a full[N]
day of rambling discussion[Beat][A]
[Left]
[Beat]Then we'd best[N]
not keep him waiting.[A]
[FarRight]
I pray the meeting goes well.[N]
Saint Theimon preserve you.[A][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[Left][ClearFace]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
That Archbishop Mureib, the[N]
Grimblade, and the Augur[Beat][N]
All together, and so soon[Beat][AN]
[Beat]I must act swiftly,[N]
before all is lost.[A][X]

## Ch14Ending_Boro
[MidLeft][LoadGrimblade]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
So Loewe is here,[N]
after all this time[Beat][AN]
No matter how hard I try,[N]
I cannot cut away my past.[AN]
Not even when the fate of[N]
Orodreth hangs in the balance[Beat][A]
[OpenFarFarRight]
Loewe, you say?[AN]
I swear I recognize[N]
that name from somewhere.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Hm? Who's there?[A]
[MidRight][LoadBoro]
[MidRight]
Call me[Beat] Boro.[A]
[MidLeft]
Not many can sneak up[N]
on me like that, Boro.[AN]
You're quite impressive already.[A]
[MidRight]
That's quite the compliment.[AN]
And who are you exactly?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I am the Grimblade.[AN]
I walk these sands for[N]
reasons of my own.[AN]
You?[A]
[MidRight]
I fought for the Decian[N]
Liberators, once. Then Cythes.[AN]
But those days are through.[AN]
Now, I'm here looking[N]
for the Spear of Mahemen.[A]
[MidLeft]
You seek the Titan's[N]
Fang[Beat] For what purpose?[AN]
Would you put it in the[N]
hands of the Sacred Arrow?[AN]
Decia? Cythes? I pray[N]
not that secret society?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
The highest bidder.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Your pouches of gold would be[N]
useless in a dying world[Beat][AN]
[Beat]What if I told you what I[N]
would do with such a relic?[AN]
I know the ancient secret to[N]
rousing it from its tomb,[AN]
but a spear would be easy prey[N]
for the Cytheans to capture[AN]
in my swordswoman's hands.[AN]
You, though?[A]
[MidRight]
So you propose a partnership,[N]
in search of the Spear?[AN]
Then I would agree.[AN]
Where shall our search[N]
start, oh Grimblade?[A]
[MidLeft]
There is an ancient temple,[AN]
buried in the depths[N]
of the Mahemen sands[Beat][A][X]

## TsourekiBossQ
[MidLeft][LoadTsoureki]
Stand strong, youths.[AN]
If you're to die on[N]
the sands this day,[AN]
you're to do it[N]
fighting your best.[A][X]

## Ch14_RadnitzSquad
[MidLeft][LoadIberis]

[FarRight][LoadHans]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Sirs Nora and Hans.[AN]
As I've stated before, with[N]
the unfortunate deaths of[N]
Lord Radnitz and Lady Epony,[AN]
I am now in command of[N]
the forces of Freyse.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Aye.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Which means I have a[N]
question for you two.[AN]
Were not the circumstances of Lord[N]
Radnitz's death deeply[Beat] suspicious?[AN]
He perished in an unknown [OpenQuote]attack"[N]
immediately after Cidor's defeat,[AN]
right when these Decian Liberators[N]
were prepared to assume power.[AN]
I trust that you[N]
understand my implications?[A]
[Right]
[Beat]I do.[AN]
But my honor demands I ask a[N]
question of my own, Lady Iberis.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Oh?[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Why should we be so quick to[N]
pin the blame on the Liberators,[AN]
and not your own ambitions?[AN]
We both know how much you hunger[N]
to reclaim nobility, Iberis.[AN]
Hans, back me up here.[A]
[FarRight]
[Beat]You both raise good points.[AN]
After Loewe's eye wound and[N]
that monster in the castle,[AN]
there's too much we don't know.[A]
[MidLeft]
Why, you[Beat]![AN]
[Beat]What Sir Hans said[N]
is correct as well.[AN]
There is too much left mysterious[N]
for usto take action yet.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox][Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Sir Hans,[AN]
you have proven your[N]
own loyalty to this[N]
cause us three bear.[AN]
In the names of both[N]
myself and Lord Radnitz,[AN]
I charge you with investigating[N]
Sir Loewe and Lady Cleo[AN]
until this sorry situation[N]
can be brought to its[N]
inevitable conclusion.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
And are we to continue[N]
fighting alongside them?[A]
[FarRight]
[Beat]We have to.[AN]
If they did kill Radnitz, we[N]
can't give our search away.[A]
[MidLeft]
Of course.[AN]
Do not forget whom it is that[N]
is Lord Radnitz's successor,[AN]
and to whom you now[N]
owe your allegiances.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]Very well, Lady Iberis.[N]
We shall see[Beat][A][X]
