Hello! You must be with the Liberators.[N]
My thanks for freeing me. Who am I?[N]
An ordinary traveler, and nothing more.[AN]
The Cytheans found me walking the dunes,[N]
and, assuming I meant ill, imprisoned me.[N]
What a cruel era today's world is in[Beat][AN]
Can a woman not wander without brutes[N]
interrupting? Ah, but I digress. I won't[N]
forget your kindness today, friends.[AN]
If we meet once more, perhaps then[N]
I can repay you in some fashion.[AN]
Until then, fight on. I suspect today[N]
is only a prelude to something more[Beat][A][X]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
So, you're the rabblerousers stirring[N]
up trouble here, eh? I suppose you[N]
deserve thanks for letting me out,[AN]
but such manners are truly-[.4] Oh,[N]
you're with the Decian Liberators?[N]
Very good, then! Allow me to join you.[AN]
Ever since Wustheim burned, so has my[N]
desire for vengeance against Cythes.[N]
I hid a few useful trinkets in my cell,[AN]
so let me put them to use annihilating[N]
our foe. By Byelen, I will break them![A][X]


## Ch15ThiefWarning
[MidLeft][LoadAlenaGrunt2][ThreeLineBox]
Heh, looks like I got here early.[N]
The rest of my boys should be here[N]
soon, ready to pilfer their coffers.[AN]
Once we've cleaned up the fort, I've[N]
a mind to check the sands. There may[N]
be a treasure or two out there[Beat][AN][X]

## Ch15CoraliaEscapes

Now I need only find that temple[Beat][A][X]

## Ch15CoraliaFleesText
[MidLeft][LoadCoralia][ThreeLineBox]
I've waited long enough. It's time[N]
to leave Fort Kreiss, while the guards[N]
are too occupied with the Liberators.[A][X]

## Ch15CoraliaFleesResponseText
[MidRight][LoadCleo][ThreeLineBox]
We must move faster[Beat] If Coralia flees,[N]
we'll have no leverage when their main[N]
force arrives. That would be [Red]our end[Beat][Red][AN]
We must [Red]capture her, alive,[Red] before she[N]
leaves Fort Kreiss if we are to survive.[A][X]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Oh? You must be one of those Liberators.[N]
Here to free us from that Kassandra, eh?[N]
As thanks for your efforts, listen well.[AN]
I've heard of a mysterious shop within[N]
the fort's confines. Never found it[N]
myself, but I saw its strange wares.[AN]
The place must be obvious to a keen eye,[N]
or they'd see no customers! Thrice I've[N]
searched, but perhaps you'll find it.[AN]
Good luck. We're all counting on you![A][X]

No[Beat] Blood? But I finally found[N]
my strength[Beat] my confidence.[AN]
Was it all for nothing? I[Beat][N]
I was a fool. Cleo, I'm sorry.[AN]
Take everyone else and run![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadElias]
[Beat]What a waste. You died for[N]
nothing, but Cleo doesn't have to.[AN]
I'll honor your last wish, fool.[N]
All troops, pull out! Our job is done![A]
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
Loewe? No[Beat] no, no, no![N]

Well, it doesn't matter now.[N]
Both of their leaders are dead,[N]
and the rest will follow.[AN]
Let's speed that process along![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

Ha[Beat] hahaha! Nothing I do ever goes[N]
the way I would wish, and now,[N]
my powerlessness claims my own sister.[AN]

[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
By Byelen[Beat] This heat is unbearable.[N]
How do the Mahemeni survive[N]
in such a blistering environment?[AN]
[Left]
They crowd around its limited oases,[N]
so you won't find them in the desert's[N]
depths. Only odd creatures live out here.[AN]
[FarRight]
Indeed. That is why our next target[N]
is so essential. Fort Kreiss guards a[N]
precious lake that rests underground,[AN]
so we must take it back immediately[N]
if we are to continue our advance.[A]
[Right]
As Archbishop Mureib said, retaking the[N]
capital is of the utmost importance,[N]
for both our strategy and morale.[AN]
Ridding Wustheim of Cythes's forces[N]
will require ample sources of water,[N]
which Fort Kreiss holds in abundance.[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]He was all too clear about that.[N]
I can still hear the archbishop's[N]
incessant lecturing, days later.[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Even so, his expertise was valuable[N]
in putting together our strategy.[AN]
We'll approach from the rear and split[N]
our forces to catch our enemy unawares.[AN]
[Right]
Loewe, I'll leave the right flank to you.[N]
Don't do anything reckless while I'm away.[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
No promises if it helps the cause.[N]
For now, I'll scout ahead to[N]
make sure our path is clear.[A][X]

## Ch15BeginningScene2Part1
[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[Beat]Good, I don't see anyone nearby.[N]
Fort Kreiss is as good as ours.[A]
[FarFarLeft]
Your senses failed you, Loewe.[N]
I thought I taught you better than that.[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[MidLeft][LoadGrimblade]
[MidRight]
Wha- You're the Grimblade![N]
What are you doing here?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
There's no need to call me that,[N]
not when we're alone. Do you not[N]
recognize your own mother's voice?[AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace][LoadCatrin][....]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
How? I thought you and Dad were dead[Beat][N]
and what happened to your face?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I earned these scars that day.[N]
After the Cytheans ambushed the[N]
villagers and killed your father,[AN]
I lost myself and went berserk.[N]
Cutting them down took everything I had.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]If you were alive,[N]
why didn't you look for me?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Their deaths were a grim reminder[Beat][N]
Running away from Cythes was selfish.[N]
I put my family above my duty to Orodreth.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
What do you mean by that?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]We can speak of that later.[N]
Surely you have other questions?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Fine, then. If you're still alive,[N]
then why did you leave your[N]
sword behind in the rubble?[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]It isn't my sword. It's yours.[AN]
[MidRight]
What are you talking about?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Tell me, have you ever been apart[N]
from it for any length of time?[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Once or twice[Beat] Why do you ask?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Did you feel ill or shaken?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Looking back on it now, I made an[N]
unexpected mistake during a mission,[N]
which landed me in House Selese's jail.[AN]
As I scouted, my ears felt as if they'd[N]
burst from ringing. You're saying[N]
it was because I didn't have my sword?[A]
[MidLeft]
In a sense. Your body is[Beat] unstable,[N]
due to a blessing from Byelen. The[N]
Kaiserschwert negates its effects,[AN]
allowing you to live a normal life.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
What would happen to me without it?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
If separated from it long enough, you[N]
would die. That's why I left it behind[N]
when I made the decision to leave you.[AN]
Well, I made sure you picked it up,[N]
of course. Wouldn't want some bandit[N]
wandering around with a magic sword.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
So you stuck around to make sure of that,[N]
but you couldn't tell me you were alive?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
It was better that you thought me dead.[N]
I had to discard my past and everything[N]
I cared for[Beat] There was no other way.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Then why are you here? Why tell me[N]
any of this if that's what you want?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I'm not heartless, Loewe. Any mother[N]
would want to see their son after all[N]
this time. I never wanted to leave you.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Then consider my request your way[N]
of atonement. Ever since we separated,[N]
I've hesitated when wielding my sword.[AN]
That is, until the other day against you.[N]
Show me what I lack so I can finish[N]
my training. That's all I ask of you.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
You want to cross blades once more?[N]
Very well, Loewe. Ready your sword![A][X]

## Ch15CatrinLoeweRound1
[MidLeft][LoadCatrin]
Well, don't just stand there.[N]
Show me what you've got![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
If you're so eager to see,[N]
then I'll make the first move![A][X]


## Ch15BeginningScene3Part1

[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[MidLeft]
Your swordsmanship is[Beat] disappointing.[N]
Is that the limit of your strength, son?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]No. Each day, I've trained, despite[N]
my self-doubt... All for this moment![N]
Prepare yourself. I won't hold back![A][X]

## Ch15CatrinLoeweRound2
[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
I will not falter. My sword[N]
will not waver ever again![AN][X]

## Ch15BeginningScene3Part2
[MidLeft][LoadCatrin]
[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
Well, what do you think of that?[N]
I beat you, fair and square![AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Don't get too cocky. You just caught me[N]
off guard, is all[Beat] even so, good work.[N]
I have nothing more to teach you.[AN]
Follow your heart, and your sword[N]
will carve a path to victory.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Thank you, for everything. With this[N]
blade in hand, I'll protect my comrades[N]
and free Orodreth from Cythes's clutches![AN][X]

## Ch15BeginningScene4
[MidLeft][LoadCatrin]
[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I'm glad to see your resolve,[N]
but we've spent enough time here.[N]
You should return to your troops.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hold a moment. You mentioned earlier[N]
your duties to Orodreth. Is that why[N]
you attacked the Augur and Kailani?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Archbishop Kailani only got in my way.[N]
The Augur, and Mureib, are my true aims.[AN]
[MidRight]
What? Is it that Cythes will use her[N]
future sight for their own devices?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
If only it was that simple[Beat] Byelen's[N]
blessed contaminate our world, even[N]
including you. The longer they live,[AN]
the closer we march to our doom.[N]
Cythes's famine is only the beginning.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
What?! You're not making sense![AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
If you wish to know about the blessed[N]
ones, the four weapons, and your sword,[N]
follow me to the Temple of Colossus.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I can't. I still have work to do,[N]
and my allies are counting on me.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]

know where to find me. Good luck.[AN][X]

Did you see anything we should know?[AN]

What's with that look?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]It's nothing. I didn't see any[N]
problems on my end. What about you two?[AN]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Not much, luckily. However, it seems that[N]
Coralia, Emperor Orfeas's granddaughter[N]
and heir, is taking refuge in Fort Kreiss.[AN]
[FarRight]
It is odd, to be sure. I assumed Cythes[N]
would guard its royals more seriously,[N]
but perhaps she has an elite guard.[AN]
[Right]
Who knows[Beat] In any case, we'd be[N]
foolish to pass up this chance.[N]
I suggest that we change our aims,[AN]
capture her, and use that to bring[N]
our remaining enemies to their knees.[AN]
[FarRight]
Hm[Beat] Indeed. We may be able to strike[N]
a deal with Cythes, trading Coralia[N]
for their immediate withdrawal.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Fine by me. I'll rip through anything[N]
in our way until not one Cythean remains.[AN]

but for now, let's begin the operation![A][X]

## Ch15BeginningScene6

[MidLeft][LoadKassandra][TwoLineBox]
Milady, do you truly wish to stay here?[N]
The rebels could reach us at any time.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
What safer haven is there? With you[N]
and Elias here, I don't suspect the[N]
rebels could triumph[Beat] right?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Not as long as we're fully manned,[N]
but the soldiers I sent with Elias[N]
haven't returned yet. Troublesome,[AN]
but when they do, we can crush[N]
any incoming force with ease.[AN][X]

## Ch15BeginningScene6Part2
[FarLeft][LoadCoralia]

[MidRight][LoadSoldier][ThreeLineBox]
Lady Coralia! The Mahemen rebels have[N]
infiltrated the fort, and they're[N]
working with the Decian Liberators![AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
It appears we spoke all too soon.[N]
How could they break past our defenses?[AN]
[FarLeft]
No doubt due to Elias's scouts failing[N]
to spot them[Beat] Ready the defenses![AN]

Y-Yes, ma'am![A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadKassandra]
[MidRight][LoadCoralia]
What are we to do, Dame Kassandra?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
We? I'm going to go find Elias,[N]
and you're going to stay put.[N]
If you poke your head out,[AN]
it's likely to be chopped off.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Elias said that I should run[N]
if the rebels were to come near.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
And? His words don't trump mine.[N]
He's lucky to retain his knighthood[N]
at all after his failure in Decia,[AN]
but our emperor is merciful indeed[N]
to place him at my disposal.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Even so[Beat] Are you certain?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Of course I am. I'm second only to Sir[N]
Leonidas in the chain of command, and[N]
he put me in charge of your protection.[AN]
You'll follow my orders, understand?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]If I must. I will leave my life[N]
in your hands, Dame Kassandra.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]

So the Liberators have already captured[N]
Lady Coralia[Beat] It seems I rushed here[N]
for nothing. What do you want, rebels?[AN]
Clearly you have something in mind.[A]
[Right]
In exchange for Lady Coralia's safety,[N]
we order that you withdraw from Mahemen[N]
in its entirety. Is this agreeable?[AN]
[Left]
Not in the slightest, and I'm sure the[N]
emperor feels the same. If we do that,[N]
our mission here is as good as dead.[AN]
[FarRight]
And if you make the wrong choice, so is[N]
his heir. Do you want that on your head?[N]
You'd surely lose your post, Azure Raven.[AN]

I'd rather not hear my title[N]

You cannot mean[Beat] you would[N]
kill Coralia? I thought knights[N]
in the Order of Iris were loyal![A]

But I am loyal, to Cythes itself.[N]
There are other heirs, and she'd be[N]
dying for the good of all Cytheans.[AN]
I can't escape with her on my pegasus,[N]
not with you two ready to pursue.[N]
If she dies here, you'll bear the blame.[AN]
This will improve morale, rid me of[N]
a constant burden, and ensure we can[N]
continue our mission in Mahemen.[AN]
A small price to pay for all that, no?[AN]
[FarLeft]
No[Beat] Please, let me keep my life![N]
I'll never return or lay claim to[N]
the throne, so long as I live![A]
[Left]
I'm afraid that isn't possible.[N]
These two will try to ransom you[N]
regardless of your own choice,[AN]
and the emperor is too soft-hearted[N]
to leave you. It's better that you die[N]
here a martyr than weigh Cythes down.[A]

empress. How is that helping anyone?[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Neither of us can get out of here fast[N]
enough with her weighing us down.[N]
She's a burden we can't afford,[AN]
better dead than in the hands of our[N]
enemies. If they use her to force us[N]
out of Mahemen, Cythes won't last long.[AN]
The famine grows stronger each day.[N]
We need hospitable land immediately,[N]
at any cost. Don't you get it, Elias?[A]
[Right]
[Beat]I do, but I can't abide killing[N]
her for it. We've stained our hands[N]
with enough blood already, Kassandra.[AN]
Must we add Cythes's heir to the pool?[A]
[Left]
Better that than all of Cythes's blood.[N]
If you mean to extend their suffering[N]
for honor's sake, then you're my enemy.[AN]
[Beat]But I'll give you one more chance,[N]
Elias. Kill Coralia, and we can still[N]
be allies. Just like we've always been.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]I can't. Over these long, hellish[N]
years, I've lost my pride, my purpose.[N]
Even so, I'm still a knight of Cythes.[AN]
I won't murder any who I am meant to[N]
protect, no matter what ends justify it![A]
[Left]
[Beat]A knight, eh? I've heard enough.[N]
The emperor will hear of your betrayal[N]
and that of your sister's. A falsehood,[AN]
yes, but the Argymos lack the standing[N]
they once had after your failure in[N]
Decia. His Majesty will believe me,[AN]
at least for now[Beat] Farewell, Elias.[N]
I pray that I never see you again,[N]
nor your annoying charge.[AN][X]

[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[FarRight]
[Beat]Elias, will you not stop her[N]
from spreading lies about you?[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Her pegasus is faster than any other[N]
I've met, and she likely has an ambush[N]
ready. Chasing her now would be unwise.[AN]
[Right]
Then what's your plan? You two are still[N]
our enemies, and I doubt you'll[N]
hand over Coralia without a fight.[A]
[Left]
Indeed, you are. Come and try me,[N]
if you wish. I'd love to get some[N]
revenge for what happened in Decia.[A]
[FarLeft]
Stop, Elias! I've seen enough bloodshed.[N]
Besides, I don't intend to challenge[N]
Kassandra. I'm done acting as an heir.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Is that why you came here, then?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That's right. I've been trying to find[N]
the reason behind the war that plagues[N]
Orodreth today, and I'm nearly there.[AN]
If my own countrymen stand in my way,[N]
then I'll have to find different allies.[N]
Who better than the famed rebel heroes?[AN]
I believe the Liberators can help me find[N]
answers to my questions, and I'm willing[N]
to share what I know in exchange.[AN]
[Right]
But we just tried to capture you[Beat][N]
You've got stones, I'll give you that.[N]
Are you really not on Cythes's side?[AN]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Thank you for the compliment, sir.[N]
I am on the side of truth. Whatever[N]
that may be is where I will stand,[AN]
even if I must do so against Cythes.[N]
[Beat]And Elias, I know you believe the[N]
emperor's path to be the only one,[AN]
but I am certain there's another way.[A]
[Left]
[Beat]If there is, then that would change[N]
everything. I can't return to explain[N]
myself to the emperor without you,[AN]
so I'll go along with your plan for now.[N]
If the Liberators will have us, that is.[N]
Do you two have any objections?[AN]
[Right]
Too many, but I recognize there's no[N]
point in fighting you both right now.[N]
Cleo, I'll leave the decision to you.[AN]
[FarRight]
[Beat]I accept your offer, Coralia. For the[N]
time being, we share an enemy, so let[N]
us cling together and find the truth.[AN]
No matter our misgivings[Beat][A][X]

[FarLeft][LoadCoralia]
[Left][LoadKwame]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
It seems you all experienced much more[N]
than we expected[Beat] If you two[N]
wish to enlist Coralia to our ranks,[AN]
I have no objections. Welcome, milady.[A]
[FarLeft]
Thank you. Let me share a bit of what[N]
I know, first. Recently, I learned that[N]
the famine and the Augur are connected.[AN]
General Leonidas wants to find her[N]
desperately, likely for her future sight.[A]
[FarRight]
[Beat]Maybe, or maybe not. The Grimblade[N]
told me that the blessed ones [OpenQuote]contaminate"[N]
Orodreth, and the Augur is no exception.[AN]
What that means, I'm not sure yet.[A]
[Right]
So that's what took you so long[N]
earlier[Beat] Can we trust her?[N]
She attempted to kill our allies.[AN]
[FarRight]
I'm certain we can. She's[Beat] the mother[N]
I thought I lost all those years ago.[N]
If there's anyone we can trust, it's her.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Catrin still lives, then?[A]
[FarRight]
What do you know of her, Kwame?[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
An explanation for another time[Beat] Still,[N]
perhaps we were fated to meet, Loewe.[N]
Whether it be good or ill, I cannot say.[A]
[FarRight]
Enough of your riddles, Kwame![N]
It's time to make good on your promise.[N]
Tell us the truth about the weapons,[AN]
the famine, everything. No more lies![AN]
[Left]
[Beat]Very well. You deserve that much, but[N]
please save any incredulity for the end.[N]
Where should I begin this unlikely tale?[AN]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
If you don't mind, the famine[N]
would be a good starting point.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Very well[Beat] To be precise, it is no[N]
famine. Cythes's land was once barren,[N]
so it is only returning to that state,[AN]
not seen for millenia. The being we[N]
know as Byelen once blessed the land,[N]
allowing it to flourish ever after[Beat][AN]
Until twenty-five years ago, when it[N]
vanished. The many blessings it provided[N]
now needed a new source of mana,[AN]
and the only one which possessed enough[N]
of it was the one placed upon Cythes.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
And when it runs out, what then?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Once Cythes's energy fades, everything[N]
in Cythes will die for the blessings next.[N]
After that, it'll try to find a new source.[AN]
It wouldn't be unlikely were that to be[N]
Orodreth itself. Then, it would be much[N]
more than just Cythes's problem.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Mass death on a scale not yet seen[Beat][N]
What could possible be draining Cythes's[N]
blessing to such an insane degree?[AN]
[Left]
Of most import are the [OpenQuote]Four Immortals,"[N]
four undying fossils who consume mana[N]
in order to maintain their divinity.[AN]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Immortals[Beat] everything I studied said[N]
it was impossible. Who are they, Kwame?[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
If you've not already guessed,[N]
I am one of them. Archbishop[N]
Mureib is surely another one,[AN]
and the other two I have not yet[N]
found. One is likely in Cythes,[N]
but I have no knowledge of the last.[AN]
There are other blessed, such as the[N]
Augur, who also pose a problem,[N]
but their impact pales in comparison.[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
How did these curses come to be?[N]
Was it something you sought out?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Of course not! We were victims in[N]
the schemes of the four heroes. After[N]
their victory over Emperor Abalon IX,[AN]
they looked to heaven for their next[N]
conquest. Using a ritual thought lost[N]
to man, they grasped for immortality,[AN]
at the cost of thousands of lives and[N]
an eternal source of energy, Byelen.[N]
I numbered one among those sacrifices.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
And yet, here you stand while they're[N]
only phantoms. Why do you still live?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Their ritual failed, but it also[N]
succeeded. Four of us sacrifices[N]
gained immortality in their stead.[AN]
However, the souls of the heroes were[N]
fused with their weapons, corrupting[N]
both. What remains are mindless husks,[AN]
clawing at any life within their reach.[A][X]

## Ch15EndingScene6Part2
[FarLeft][LoadCoralia]
[Left][LoadKwame]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
This is[Beat] much more than I expected to[N]
learn when I suggested we band together.[N]
What do you propose we do, Kwame?[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]We have two options. We can slay[N]
the immortals or attempt a ritual[N]
to remove their blessing.[A]
[Right]
Will slaying them truly solve our[N]
problems? How do we even find them,[N]
let alone kill them if they don't die?[AN]
[Left]
It will not return Cythes's blessing[N]
to what it once was, but it will slow[N]
its decline. As for finding them,[AN]
I can sense any nearby blessing with[N]
this pendant, provided I'm far away[N]
from Loewe's sword when I check.[AN]
Any holy tool should be enough to kill[N]
an immortal, but I haven't tested the[N]
theory. There are[Beat] limited subjects.[AN]
[FarRight]
We'll have to figure it out ourselves.[N]
Still, that hidden pendant is curious[Beat][N]
What about my sword interferes with it?[AN]
[Left]
The Kaiserschwert erases the power[N]
of the blessings, which the Halaka[N]
Suhaja requires to function properly.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Hm[Beat] Well, what of our other[N]
option? How does this ritual function?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Even I don't know every detail of it.[N]
However, one thing is clear in the texts.[N]
We'll need all four of the weapons,[AN]
as well as the Four Immortals. The payoff[N]
is that the ritual will return some of [N]
their ill-gotten blessings to Cythes.[AN]
[FarLeft]
If that's the case, then perhaps we can[N]
convince some Cytheans to side with us[Beat][AN]
Regardless, let us focus on our next[N]
move first. If Loewe's mother is headed[N]
to the temple, we should quickly follow.[AN]
We may need the lance, after all.[AN]
[Right]
Yes, and there's no telling what her[N]
aims are. We need to ascertain whether[N]
she is our foe or our friend, Loewe.[AN]
Of course, we won't inform Archbishop[N]
Mureib of our little detour, either.[N]
We don't know if we can trust him.[A]
[FarRight]
[Beat]Then our course is set. One more[N]
thing, Kwame. What of the lesser[N]
blessed? What will happen to them?[AN]
[Left]
Finding them all will be difficult[Beat][N]
Even so, they too are a potential threat.[N]
It would be best if they perished.[AN]
Also, don't forget that Cythes is still[N]
our enemy. If we wish to lay them low,[N]
then the ritual is actually worse.[AN]
They may recover afterwards, and if the[N]
emperor still harbors his ambitions[N]
of conquest, this will only hurt us.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]We can worry about that later. For now,[N]
let's begin our preparations to visit the[N]
temple. Kwame, I'd like your assistance.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Very well. Let us start at once.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I'll explain everything to Elias[N]
when he gets back from scouting.[N]
It may take a while, though[Beat][AN][X]

## Ch15EndingScene6Part3
[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Now Mom's words make more sense.[N]
If Kwame's worries prove true, then[N]
my life is a danger to Orodreth, too.[AN]
All for a blessing that would kill me[N]
without the Kaiserschwert by my side[Beat][AN]
More like a curse. I only wanted to free[N]
Decia and crush Cythes, but now I'm[N]
supposed to sacrifice myself for them?[AN]
[Beat]Well, I don't have to decide yet.[N]
For now, I'll destroy any Cytheans in[N]
my way until I must make a choice[Beat][A][X]

Later that day...[A][X]
