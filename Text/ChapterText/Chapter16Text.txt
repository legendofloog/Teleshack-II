## Ch16_Cleo_Open

[MidRight][LoadYoungCleo][ThreeLineBox]
Tee hee! You're so funny, Horace.[N]
Look at you, just clucking around.[N]
Pecking the ground and all that.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Cluck cluck![A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Are you dancing now?[N]
Hoo boy, Horace, you sure are[N]
one funny bird, I can tell you that![A]
[MidLeft][LoadLeonidas]
Ah, there you are, Cleo.[N]
I see you've been tending to[N]
the fowl again.[AN]
Varga was looking for you.[N]
He told me you've been slacking[N]
on your studies again.[A]
[MidRight]
S-slacking? I ain't no slacker, father![N]
I really, honest to Byelen, mean it![N]
Varga's just, well, really tough, you know?[A]
[MidLeft]
It seems I let you spend too much time[N]
away in our country home. You speak[N]
like common rabble. Hideous.[AN]
You are a proud Argymos heiress.[N]
Our line has stood by the Cytheans for[N]
generations and owe much to the crown.[AN]
To disrespect that kindness with your[N]
poor conduct would bring naught[N]
but shame to our family.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
F-father, what are you doing?[N]
Put Horace back down![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat] You should never treat farm animals[N]
like pets, Cleo. You'll only grow attached.[N]
Times are tough. Harvests grow weaker.[AN]
In this world[Beat][N]
The strong will always prevail over the weak.[N]
My daughter will not be weak.[A]
[MidRight]
Horace! But Father[Beat] Horace didn't[N]
do anything wrong. He's just an innocent[N]
bird. Just a funny old bird[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
Stop your sobbing, Cleo.[N]
If you wanted to save Horace,[N]
you must grow strong. Understand?[AN]
Knights are strong and protect those[N]
that they care about and are loyal to.[N]
You were too weak to protect Horace.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[CloseEyes]Sniff[Beat] Father[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
Stop crying, Cleo.[A]
[MidRight]
Horace[Beat] Why[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You should've been stronger, Cleo.[N]
Go on, try to strike me down.[N]
Take that knife. Do it.[A]
[MidRight]
[OpenEyes]Huh[Beat] Where[Beat][N]
Where did I get this knife?[N]
Father[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
You loved Horace, did you not?[N]
Then you should've fought to protect him![N]
Go on, try to strike me down, Cleo![AN]
You said it yourself you will stop at[N]
nothing to achieve your goals! You[N]
want revenge for Dragana's death, no?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Father[Beat] I-I[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat] Hesitation will lead to failure, Cleo.[N]
You will never pay back Dragana's kindness.[N]
Not unless you act. Not unless you fight.[AN]
You were too weak to save this bird.[N]
Next time, will you be strong enough to save[N]
those who mean even more to you?[AN]
Will you be able to stare death in the face?[N]
Risk your life to do what is important to you?[N]
You must act to achieve your goals, Cleo.[AN]
Otherwise, you will be no better off than[N]
Horace here. A fowl waiting for the slaughter.[N]
Do you understand me, Cleo?[AN]
Take the knife, Cleo. Kill me.[N]
Go on. Gut me like you did Radnitz![N]
Show me what you're capable of![A]
[MidRight]
Radnitz[Beat][N]
Dragana[Beat][N]
Horace[Beat] Waaaah![A]
[FarFarLeft][OneLineBox]
Cleo[Beat] Cleo[Beat][A]
[MidRight]
Huh? What's going on?![A][X]

## Ch16_Cleo_Elias

[MidRight][LoadCleo][MidLeft][LoadElias]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Cleo, wake up.[N]
I know you had a late watch,[N]
but I was surprised to see you asleep.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Elias?[N]
What are you doing here?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat] I got you food from the barracks.[N]
It's Mahemeni chicken rice.[N]
The sauce is quite nice.[AN]
Would you like some?[N]
I got you a coffee as well.[N]
Figured you may need it today.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat] No, I am not hungry.[N]
I will take the coffee though. Thank you.[N]
[Beat] Did you sleep alright?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] About as well as I can expect to.[N]
I never expected our reunion to be[N]
like this, you know?[AN]
[MidRight]
Indeed[Beat][N]
At the very least, I am glad that we are[N]
on the same side for a change.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] For now.[N]
My loyalty is still to the crown[N]
and to our father, Cleo.[AN]
If Coralia wants to leave,[N]
I will not hesitate to take wing.[N]
I still have my duties, after all.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat] Fair enough, Elias.[N]
We all have our duties.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
What is your duty here, Cleo?[N]
You should consider coming home.[N]
You accomplished your goal, no?[AN]
Decia is liberated.[N]
Is your objective not complete?[N]
Come home to your family, Cleo.[A]
[MidRight]
I don't think that will happen.[N]
If I return to Cythes,[N]
it will be on my own terms.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
The path you walk is dangerous, Cleo.[N]
Do you truly think it wise?[N]
That your way is best?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
We should get ready to depart.[N]
We ride to the Temple of Colossus.[N]
Loewe and Kwame made the arrangements.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat] Very well. Thank you for the coffee.[N]
I will be ready in just a few minutes.[N]
I'll meet you outside.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Cleo[Beat][A]
[MidRight]
Yes, brother?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Just remember something for me.[N]
Every path you walk has a choice.[N]
Every action, a consequence.[AN]
Knowing what we both now know,[N]
are you willing to stand by your convictions?[N]
[Beat] Even if it makes us enemies?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Yes, brother. I will not waver.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat] That is all I need ask, then.[N]
Very well, sister. I will take my leave.[A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[CloseEyes][Beat][N]
[OpenEyes]Hm? He left something.[AN]
Elias is so diligent, this is unlike him.[N]
Is it[Beat] our family crest?[AN]
He carried it for me all this way.[N]
Elias[Beat][A][X]

## VargaPrf

[MidLeft][LoadElias][MidRight][LoadVarga]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Varga, thank you for the report.[N]
As thorough as ever. I appreciate[N]
your diligence, as usual.[A]
[MidRight]
It is no trouble, Sir Elias.[N]
Quite a lot more has happened[N]
than any of us expected.[AN]
And yet, Cleo continues to[N]
push forward. Perhaps a bit too[N]
relentlessly, in fact.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] She's changed.[N]
I just finished speaking with her.[N]
The fire in her eyes cannot be doused.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Indeed.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Varga[Beat] while I have this opportunity,[N]
I wanted to give you something.[N]
To thank you for your service.[A]
[MidRight]
The Aqua Brand[Beat][N]
A blade infused with azurium.[N]
Sir Elias, this is a generous gift.[AN]
I will wield it proudly.[A][X]

## EmilPrf

[MidLeft][LoadElias][MidRight][LoadEmil]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
So, Emil, I see you are still[N]
standing. I am not surprised[N]
at all. You looked battle hardened.[A]
[MidRight]
It's all thanks to you, after all.[N]
That fights are tough, but it's[N]
been good learning.[A]
[MidLeft]
Keep that optimism, Emil.[N]
It will serve you well, no matter[N]
what trials you may face.[AN]
That said, I did want you to take this.[N]
It is a Cythean lance I felt[N]
would be a good fit for you.[A]
[MidRight]
Sir Elias[Beat][N]
I have no words.[N]
I will use it well.[A][X]

## Ch16_Opening_3

[FarLeft][LoadKwame][Left][LoadLoewePunished][Right][LoadElias][FarRight][LoadCleo]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Good. We are all accounted for.[N]
We should not dally any longer.[N]
We head to the Temple of Colossus.[A]
[Left]
My mother[Beat] The Grimblade[Beat][N]
she said we can learn the secrets of the[N]
Four Immortals and the weapons there.[AN]
Impractical as it may be to go, we[N]
can't afford to stay ignorant to the truth.[N]
We have to go, regardless of the risks.[A]
[Right]
I see[Beat] I do not have objections.[N]
However, I urge you to consider the[N]
implications if we are seen together.[AN]
You are in league with those who stand[N]
against the Cythean occupation.[N]
You will be branded traitors.[A]
[FarLeft]
One could say the same for you being seen[N]
with us, Master Elias. Changing sides[N]
with the tides is not uncommon.[AN]
A knight of an esteemed Cythean family[N]
abandoning his duty to support his[N]
dearest sister? Poetic, in fact.[AN]
I say this not to provoke you,[N]
but to highlight the risks.[N]
Truthfully, we are all in danger.[AN]
However, I agree with Master Loewe.[N]
Catrin would not lead us astray.[N]
She has not let me down yet.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Kwame[Beat] I still don't know how[N]
you know my mother.[AN]
You said you would tell us everything.[N]
Speak, Kwame.[A]
[FarLeft]
The journey will take some time.[N]
Allow me to explain along the way.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][Left][ClearFace]
[Right]
Cleo, are you coming?[N]
You seem distracted.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Hm? My apologies. My mind was elsewhere.[N]
I suppose I could've used two cups[N]
of coffee this morning.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
We should not linger.[A][X]

## Ch16_Opening_4

[MidLeft][LoadKwame][MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I see[Beat] So that is how you met.[N]
This all makes sense now. I remember[N]
some of this from when I was small.[A]
[MidLeft]
Correct. Catrin had come into my lord's[N]
employment in Chouwouj as a hired blade.[N]
After the royal family of Chouwouj fell,[AN]
a great power struggle ensued,[N]
and many lords began amassing forces.[N]
I was the[Beat][AN]
advisor, to one such lord for a time.[A]
[MidRight]
But why were you in Chouwouj? And[N]
how did you become an advisor? Kwame,[N]
every answer begs two more questions.[A]
[MidLeft]
When you have lived as long as I have,[N]
you get to live many lives.[N]
It is as I said when we first met.[AN]
You may consider me fortunate or unlucky,[N]
but it is all a matter of perspective.[N]
Nevertheless, I know Catrin from then.[AN]
She was honest and reliable, but most[N]
importantly to Lord Dikembe, she delivered.[N]
We won more than we lost.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
So why did you both leave?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Your mother served Lord Dikembe during your[N]
infancy, leaving you with your father.[N]
As time went on, she grew depressed.[AN]
She yearned to be with her dear son.[N]
She decided to return to Mahemen to[N]
be with her family. A noble pursuit, I say.[AN]
Soon after, tides turned in Chouwouj,[N]
and Lord Dikembe was slain in battle.[N]
I fled and have wandered ever since.[A]
[MidRight]
I see[Beat] Thank you, Kwame.[N]
I was so young when I thought I lost her[Beat][N]
To know she cared so much[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
There was never doubt of her love. It[N]
was that love that pushed her.[N]
Truth be told, I was moved by it.[AN]
She could be whatever she[N]
wanted in this world, and she chose to[N]
pursue family. Few have such strength.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Mother[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Well, I've droned on about the past long[N]
enough. Do you not see it, Master Loewe?[N]
We are approaching the temple.[A]
[MidRight]
I do[Beat][N]
Let's make sure everyone is ready.[N]
We don't know what to expect[Beat][A][X]

## Ch16_Opening_5

[FarLeft][LoadKwame][Left][LoadLoewePunished][Right][LoadCatrin]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
So, you have come to learn the truth?[N]
It warms my heart to see you again.[N]
I trust the journey was smooth?[AN]
[Left]
Mother[Beat][N]
Yes. We come seeking the truth.[N]
That's why I brought everyone here.[AN]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Including the Cythean heir, I see?[A]
[Left]
[Beat] I can explain that all later.[A]
[Right]
Very well, let us head inside.[A]
[FarRight][LoadBoro][ThreeLineBox]
I found the path to the altar.[N]
We just need to-[N]
What? The Decian Liberators?[AN]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][FarLeft][LoadCleo][OneLineBox]
Boro[Beat][A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Mother, do you know who this man is?[AN]
Boro, what are you doing here?[A]
[FarRight]
I should ask you lot the same thing.[N]
What are you scheming, woman?[A]
[Right]
I am no schemer, Boro.[N]
I can explain everything.[AN]
First, we must head inside the temple.[N]
Boro, lead the way.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Alright.[A][X]

## Ch16_Opening_6 

[FarLeft][LoadCleo][Left][LoadLoewePunished][Right][LoadCatrin][FarRight][LoadBoro]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
This is it[Beat] The Titan's Fang.[N]
One of the four legendary weapons.[A]
[FarRight]
Surprised it's just sitting here so casually.[N]
It was a little too easy to waltz right in[Beat][A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
So what now? We just take it?[N]
I don't have to pull[N]
it from a stone or anything?[AN]
[Right][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Be careful.[A]
[FarFarLeft][TwoLineBox]
So[Beat] You have come to[N]
take me from my tomb[Beat][A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Huh!? Who[Beat] Who goes there?[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][Right][ClearFace][FarRight][ClearFace]
[Right][LoadHamdi][ThreeLineBox]
I am Hamdi. I am the wielder of[N]
the Titan's Fang, the lance blessed by Byelen.[N]
I have become one with the spear.[AN]
[Left]
Sir Hamdi[Beat] your name was never stated[N]
directly in the Book of Havarti, but[N]
I have no doubt of your claim.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadKwame]
The Halaka Suhaja glows[Beat][N]
Hamdi[Beat] What is going on?[N]
How are you able to speak with us?[AN]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Silence, immortal.[N]
I have no desire to speak with you.[AN]
[FarLeft]
You would speak to me so callously!?[AN]
It was your wretched ritual[N]
that killed thousands![AN]
Some may say I am a benefactor,[N]
but I stand on the shoulders of corpses![A]
[Right]
I will only speak with the wielder of the blade.[N]
For it is the power of the Kaiserschwert[AN]
that allows me to take this form before[N]
my soul is completely consumed by madness.[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
This sword[Beat] it suppresses the blessings[N]
of Byelen[Beat] Does his blessing drive[N]
you mad, Hamdi?[A]
[Right]
The ritual the immortal spoke of[N]
was my undoing. My greatest folly.[N]
I became enveloped in my own hell.[AN]
The immortals who walk Orodreth[N]
received the desired effects of[N]
the ritual, while thousands perished.[AN]
For me and my fellow heroes of the[N]
Reclamation Wars, our souls became tied[N]
to the very weapons that made our names.[AN]
Now, the sordid soul of the weapon[N]
threatens to engulf my sanity entirely.[N]
I fear my consciousness is almost gone.[AN]
Come, wielder of the Kaiserschwert.[N]
Ask me what you wish to know.[N]
While I can never atone for my foul deeds,[AN]
I can help ensure that other rectify[N]
the horrid mistakes that cast a long[N]
shadow over the continent.[AN]
[Left]
Kwame told us there is a ritual[N]
that removes the blessing of the weapons[N]
and the Four Immortals[Beat][AN]
To do so, we need to gather each of[N]
the weapons and individuals affected,[N]
so they may return their blessing.[AN]
On that fateful day[Beat][N]
Do you know of the others who yet live?[N]
The remaining immortals?[AN]
[Right]
Yes. In my long years trapped in this[N]
tomb, I have learned much of Orodreth.[N]
Allow me to share the names of the Four.[AN]
The first, Kwame, stands before you.[N]
The second, Mureib, you have also met[N]
previously. An archbishop of Mahemen.[AN]
The third immortal is a warlord of Chouwouj.[N]
On the field of battle, she is The Pitviper.[N]
To her family, she is known as Taraji.[AN]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Taraji[Beat] it all makes sense now.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Silence![N]
Lastly, the final immortal is a man.[AN]
His name is Barod.[N]
He resides on the Yuria Islands.[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
The arena master!?[N]
But[Beat] Kwame said one of the[N]
immortals was in Cythes.[AN]
[Right]
The immortal is mistaken.[N]
The individual he seeks is beyond immortal.[N]
They are eternal. They are Byelen.[AN]
[FarRight][ClearFace][FarRight][LoadCleo]
You mean to say Byelen has taken[N]
a physical form in Cythes?[N]
Who are they!?[AN]
[Right][OneLineBox]
I do not know, young Cythean.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
My mother told me I was blessed[N]
as well by Byelen.[N]
That my mana is unstable.[AN]
That this sword helps me live a[N]
normal life.[N]
What is my blessing?[AN]
[Right]
You do not know your own blessing?[N]
Then you have carried the blade without[N]
understanding its true purpose?[AN]
I see[Beat][N]
Even with the suppression of the blade,[N]
I can feel your mana swelling.[AN]
There is no doubting it.[N]
You are the Seed.[N]
You are the next blessing.[AN]
[Left][OneLineBox]
The[Beat] Seed?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
[OpenQuote]Byelen blessed the barren lands[N]
so that the people of Cythes could eat.[N]
Byelen blessed the four weapons,[AN]
so that the people could be protected.[N]
Byelen purified the waters[N]
so that the people could drink.[AN]
When dark clouds begin their advance[N]
and cast shadows over the land[N]
the bells will ring to call forth the one.[AN]
The Seed of Byelen will renew his blessings[N]
restoring mana to the land to ensure[N]
the sun may shine on Orodreth evermore."[AN]
Do you hear the bells?[N]
They are ringing.[N]
They call for you, Loewe.[A]
[Left]
I am[Beat] the Seed of Byelen?[N]
The pain I feel without the blade[Beat][N]
The bells of Byelen ring in my ears?[AN]
[FarRight][ClearFace][FarRight][LoadCatrin]
Yes[Beat] what Hamdi says is true.[N]
I wanted you to live a normal life, Loewe[Beat][N]
I am sorry[Beat][AN]
Once I learned of your condition[N]
I returned to Mahemen to give you the blade.[N]
But[Beat] there is no running from the truth[.A]
[Right]
Your death will release mana like[N]
a tidal wave unto the continent.[N]
All of Orodreth will flourish with mana.[AN]
The harvests will return. The[N]
world will be saved by the Seed. At[N]
least, until it withers,[AN]
and a new Seed is born.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
This is[Beat] all quite a lot to take in.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
I have spoken for too long[Beat][N]
my spirit weakens[Beat][N]
Take the lance and go![AN]
For my dark side has planned[N]
many traps for you. Heed my warning![N]
If you take the spear, run![AN]
The beast that loiters below[N]
will emerge. Go, before my better nature[N]
is completely overcome![Beat][AN]
[Right][ClearFace]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Hamdi![A]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Loewe, he's gone.[N]
Grab the spear. We must go.[A][X]

## Ch16_Opening_7

[MidLeft][LoadCatrin][MidRight][LoadBoro]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
This isn't what I bargained for, Grimblade.[N]
You deceived me.[A]
[MidLeft]
Chastise me later.[N]
We need to help them escape.[A]
[MidRight]
Hmph[Beat] very well.[N]
Liberators! Whatever lurks below,[AN]
we will hold it off.[N]
Take the spear and leave![A][X]

## Ch16_PostPreps_RashidIntro

[MidLeft][LoadRashid]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
So someone has come to take the Fang?[N]
It is about damn time.[N]
It feels good to stretch.[AN]
While the others lost their minds long ago,[N]
my conscious still remains.[N]
Perhaps I can be of use[Beat][A][X]

## Ch16_Rashid_Recruitment

[MidLeft][LoadRashid][MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Perish, phantom![N]
Go back to the darkness[N]
from whence you came![A]
[MidLeft]
Phantom I may be, I am not like them.[N]
I am a departed soul from the[N]
Reclamation Wars[Beat] A soldier[Beat][AN]
Our souls trapped and warped.[N]
While others gradually lost themselves[N]
To madness, my conscience remained.[AN]
Please[Beat] let me aid you![A]
[MidRight]
[Beat] I would say this is outright ridiculous,[N]
But I am still processing what I just heard.[N]
Anything funny, and you are dead.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That is all? Will not be a problem.[N]
To my friends, I am Rashid.[N]
To my enemies, I am the Sidewinder![AN]
Come, let me show you how I once fought![A][X]

## Ch16_Kofi_Recruitment

[MidLeft][LoadKofi]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
So[Beat] this temple was a tomb[N]
all along[Beat] A significant finding.[N]
It appears my trip bore fruit.[AN]
[Beat] Hm? That man[Beat] he feels[N]
familiar in a way[Beat][N]
How very strange.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Hm? Who are you?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I'm[Beat] Kofi. An explorer.[N]
I seek to unravel the mysteries[N]
of Orodreth. Pay me no mind.[AN]
[MidRight]
Look, I don't know how you got in here,[N]
or what your motives are,[N]
but there's no time.[AN]
This place is quickly becoming dangerous.[N]
I suggest you turn tail and[N]
run to the entrance.[A]
[MidLeft]
Although looks may deceive, I am adept[N]
in both blades and magic.[N]
I will aid you.[A]
[MidRight]
Very well, Kofi.[N]
I'm Loewe.[N]
Let's make our way out.[A][X]

## Colossus_1
[MidRight][LoadBoro][MidLeft][LoadCatrin]
Hngh[Beat] They just keep[N]
on coming.[A]
[MidRight]
We shouldn't stick around much longer.[N]
There are footsteps down below.[A]
[MidLeft]
Yes[Beat] he has awoken from his slumber.[N]
Boro. We should get going.[AN]
Let's hope we've done enough to give[N]
the rest time to escape.[A]
[MidRight]
Good. I thought you'd be willing to die here.[N]
Because I'm not.[AN]
Let's go.[N]
Hurry! To the exit![A][X]

## Ch16_Ending

[MidLeft][LoadCatrin]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
We must keep moving.[N]
I have a safehouse for us to rest.[N]
With me. Quickly.[A][X]

## Ch16_Council_1
[Left][LoadKwame]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
So, we are all gathered now.[N]
Thank you Catrin for housing us,[N]
and for procuring refreshments.[AN]
I trust everyone has had a moment to[N]
catch their collective breath.[N]
For now, we must discuss our plan.[AN]
The Temple of Colossus was truly the[N]
Temple of Good Fortune, for Hamdi,[N]
in his fleeting moments,[AN]
gave us food for thought.[AN]
There are many paths we can choose,[N]
all with their own benefits,[AN]
and drawbacks. There is never[N]
an easy answer or solution.[AN]
I have pondered a few possible courses[N]
of action, and I am keen to hear[N]
your reactions to each.[AN]
That said, I'd first like to[N]
open the floor to any opening[N]
comments or questions.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
I will speak first.[N]
We now know the identities of[N]
the Four Immortals.[AN]
We also have three of the weapons.[N]
Meanwhile, Mahemen continues to be[N]
battered by Cythes.[AN]
While we know Cythes' motivations[N]
lie partially in its famines[N]
and conquest for resources,[AN]
there is no doubt that the divine[N]
weapons are also on their agenda.[N]
The Mahemeni lance is now ours.[AN]
Once they figure this out,[N]
their plan of action may change.[N]
However, Mahemen is weak.[AN]
[Left]
So, you predict regardless of whether[N]
we reveal that we have the lance,[N]
or if they are to find out,[AN]
that their conquest of Mahemen[N]
will continue?[AN]
[MidRight]
Precisely.[N]
Mahemen is already losing.[N]
After their loss in Decia,[AN]
Cythean morale decreased.[N]
A victory here will still show[N]
Orodreth, and more importantly,[AN]
Cythes, that there is strength yet.[AN]
[Left]
Well stated, Lady Cleo.[N]
With this in mind, there are three[N]
paths we can take.[AN]
I will state them and have you each[N]
share your thoughts on the matter.[N]
Allow me to begin with the first.[AN]
To start, we learned Byelen has taken[N]
a mortal form and resides in Cythes.[N]
I sense they're part of this.[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace][Right][LoadElias][FarRight][LoadCoralia]
[Right]
You think the goddess is pulling[N]
the strings behind Orfeas' actions?[N]
I know of no such figure.[A]
[FarRight]
There are few advisors who my grandfather[N]
keeps close, but none come to mind[N]
as being so nefarious.[A]
[Left]
[Beat] Regardless, another option is to head[N]
to Cythes to find Byelen and learn more.[N]
With Sir Elias and Lady Coralia,[AN]
I predict we would have little trouble[N]
navigating the court to learn more about[N]
the Emperor and Byelen's aims.[A]
[Right]
We also have to consider Kassandra.[N]
She will spin a web of lies,[N]
speaking of our treachery.[AN]
These falsehoods cannot stand.[A]
[FarRight]
I still struggle to believe Kass[N]
would betray us.[N]
But she spoke so cruelly[Beat][AN]
I worry for our safety there.[N]
Especially if we allow her to roam[N]
unimpeded, with only her truth.[AN]
Delaying our return is frought with risk.[AN]
[Right]
I am inclined to agree.[N]
However, this path is also dangerous.[N]
We are walking into the jaws of death.[AN]
The Cythean Empire does not simply allow[N]
armies to roam about their borders.[N]
And certainly not ones it sees as enemies.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Indeed. If we were to return to Cythes,[N]
how would you suggest we do so?[A]
[Right]
We would need to charter a boat.[N]
The overland routes are too well-guarded.[AN]
Northern Cythes is less populous,[N]
it'd be easier to navigate unseen.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
The frozen barrens of Mount[N]
Saarloos[Beat][N]
Few dare to venture there.[AN]
There are only a few outposts[N]
stationed there for mines[N]
and potato farms. It's sparse.[AN]
[Left]
Yes. The terrain would greet us[N]
more coldly than Cytheans there.[N]
It would not be a smooth journey.[AN]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
But what about the Yurian Islands?[N]
Is there not one of your Immortals there?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Aye. However, Barod would be the least[N]
of our concerns, at least for now.[AN]
I would suggest we deal with him later,[N]
for there are more time sensitive tasks.[A]
[FarRight]
Very well, it was merely a suggestion.[N]
Tell us of your other options.[A][X]

## Ch16_Council_1_2
[Left][LoadKwame][ThreeLineBox]
Thank you, milady.[N]
Our second option is set before us.[N]
We are in Mahemen, after all.[AN]
Cythes continues to occupy her,[N]
and Mureib and the rebels weaken.[N]
We can choose to stand and drive back[AN]
the Cytheans by their side to earn trust,[N]
or we can craft a scheme to deceive them,[N]
and capture Mureib for our own gain.[AN]
Regardless, we know not what Mureib[N]
will do with now that we have[N]
we have Lady Coralia in our ranks.[AN]
[Beat] We best tread carefully.[AN]
I recommend we head to Chouwouj.[N]
I am well-acquainted with Taraji,[N]
for they slayed my liege lord.[AN]
[Right][LoadCatrin]
I have crossed blades with Taraji.[N]
They are rumored as unkillable.[N]
It seems we now know why.[AN]
[Left]
Indeed, Catrin.[N]
I would also add that we know[N]
little of the sword's whereabouts.[AN]
The sword of Cythes,[N]
its name still lost to time,[N]
was stolen from them long ago.[AN]
With no leads here or in Decia,[N]
Chouwouj is the most likely suspect.[N]
The Pitviper, immortal as she is,[AN]
may seek to answer the call of[N]
the undying blade[Beat][N]
Although, this is mere speculation.[AN]
However, we may find allies in Chouwouj.[AN]
We will need to increase our forces[N]
in order to stand up to Cythes. Thus,[N]
I find this to be the best course.[AN]
[FarRight][LoadBoro]
I get your angle, Kwame,[N]
but we would be opening our rear[N]
if we were to head south.[AN]
If Mureib gets a whiff that we aren't on[N]
their side all the way,[N]
we risk getting flanked.[AN]
If Mureib cares to save their own[N]
hide, with their backs against the wall,[N]
they may ally with Cythes.[AN]
Sell out their kingdom and fellow[N]
bishops to keep their position.[N]
That could spell trouble.[AN]
[Left]
I do not think Mureib has the[N]
strength to pursue us and fend off[N]
the Cytheans. You are correct.[AN]
As long as we stay within their borders,[N]
we will be seen as a threat unless[N]
we fully ally with them.[AN]
You are right that leaving here[N]
would open up chance of a truce.[N]
It is frought with risk.[AN]
However, knowing Mureib,[N]
they will not willingly go along[N]
with our plan to remove the blessing.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadLoewePunished]
Why do you think that, Kwame?[N]
You seem fairly willing to go[N]
through with it, after all.[A]
[Left]
I have lived long enough, Master Loewe.[N]
If my death could save millions,[N]
I would make that choice every time.[AN]
Would you not?[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Yes, lest we forget the words of Hamdi.[N]
If what he speaks is true,[N]
you are the Seed.[AN]
While I do not fully understand[N]
the implications or how it came to be,[N]
you are an important player on this stage.[A]
[Right]
I will not let Loewe die![N]
There has to be another way[N]
to end this madness![A]
[Left]
Peace, Catrin. We will continue[N]
to search a solution to this problem.[N]
There are many unknowns still.[A][X]

## Ch16_Council_2

[FarLeft][LoadCleo][Left][LoadKwame][Right][LoadCatrin][FarRight][LoadBoro]
[FarLeft]
I made up my mind.[N]
We should deal with Mureib first.[N]
We plan our next move from there.[AN]
By defeating Cythes here, we weaken[N]
their forces and save Mahemen,[N]
putting Mureib in our debt.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
And what if Mureib does not wish[N]
to participate in the ritual, Cleo?[N]
What then?[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] We make them do it.[A]
[Left]
How do you suggest we do that?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
If we ally with Mahemen and[N]
drive out the Cytheans,[N]
Mureib will be in our debt.[AN]
Additionally, we will make allies[N]
with the other archbishops.[N]
While I know little of Bylenism,[AN]
I know human struggles for power.[N]
We could get the others to turn[N]
on Mureib if we befriend them.[AN]
Get them to stab his back.[N]
We get our objective, they get[N]
more power for themselves.[AN]
[FarRight]
I am with you, Cleo.[N]
Take care of the problem in front of us.[N]
Make Cythes retreat to their borders.[AN]
This will only help us achieve our other[N]
objectives down the line.[A]
[FarLeft]
Our objectives?[N]
I did not think you would ally yourself[N]
with us again, Boro.[A]
[FarRight]
Hearing Hamdi's tale and Catrin's story[Beat][N]
it put a lot into perspective for me.[N]
I wanted the gold for the relic,[AN]
but what good is gold in a dying world?[N]
Working together once more seems best.[N]
[Beat] Dragana would want it that way.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Dragana[Beat][A][X]


## Ch16_Council_3

[Left][LoadKwame][ThreeLineBox]
Now then, we've all heard the[N]
cases for each course of action.[N]
I'd like to hear final votes.[AN]
While many of you present[N]
interesting cases and reasoning,[N]
I am unmoved.[AN]
I believe Chouwouj is our best path.[N]
My second preference is for dealing[N]
with Mureib here and now.[A]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
My vote is for the Mahemen plan.[N]
We have unfinished business.[N]
Let's do this first.[AN]
If the group decides another path[N]
is better, then I will oblige.[N]
We'll make it work.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace][MidRight][LoadCoralia]
The Augur spoke of a catastrosphe[Beat][N]
It'd be prudent to try and prevent that.[N]
I think Cythes is the answer.[AN]
If not to prevent Kassandra from[N]
sullying our names, but to find Byelen[N]
and end this without more bloodshed.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace][MidRight][LoadElias]
I agree with Lady Coralia.[N]
I would prefer we return to Cythes.[N]
I'll be your guide.[AN]
The frozen north is not kind[Beat][N]
but it would be our best way to[N]
satisfy our objectives and yours.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace][MidRight][LoadCatrin]
I am with you, Kwame.[N]
I'd like to go to Chouwouj.[N]
Getting all of the weapons[Beat][AN]
It is the key in how we end[N]
this soon. We can deal with[N]
Mureib later.[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace][MidRight][LoadBoro][ThreeLineBox]
I'm with Cleo.[N]
[Beat] Don't leave business unfinished.[N]
Let's stay in Mahemen for now.[AN]
These other plans[Beat][N]
Well, let's say I'm through[N]
chasing ghosts.[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[Left]
So it seems we are at a crossroads.[N]
Deadlocked in the path forward.[N]
A hung jury, as it were[Beat][A]
[FarLeft][LoadCleo]
I would like to hear Loewe's opinion.[N]
I think it is clear where each[N]
of us stands at this point.[A]
[Right][LoadLoewePunished]
I need to think.[N]
I[Beat] cannot decide now.[N]
There is a lot to take in.[A]
[Left]
The weight of the burden on[N]
your shoulders is quite heavy.[N]
I do not blame you for needing time.[AN]
You are the hammer, the final vote.[N]
I suggest you take time to mull over[N]
the options and considerations.[AN]
However, we cannot afford to wait.[N]
We will need to make a decision[N]
no later than tomorrow morning.[A]
[Right]
Ah[Beat] alright. I will keep[N]
what everyone said in mind.[N]
Thank you[Beat] everyone.[A][X]

## Ch16_Ending_LoeweCleoNight_1

[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Sigh[Beat] what to do?[N]
If I really am the Seed[Beat][N]
do I need to die to save everyone?[AN]
This has all changed so fast.[N]
Not long ago, we were Liberators.[N]
Fighting for our nation.[AN]
Now[Beat] the entire fate of Orodreth[N]
is at stake? And why do I have this power?[N]
My mother must know more[Beat][A][X]

## Ch16_Ending_LoeweCleoNight_2

[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished][MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Cleo[Beat][N]
How are you doing?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I thought I might find you out here.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
There's a lot on my mind, Cleo.[N]
The thoughts are swirling like[N]
a cyclone. It is hard to make sense of it.[AN]
Do you really think that we need[N]
to do what Kwame suggests?[N]
That we need to do this ritual?[A]
[MidLeft]
Truthfully, I am unsure.[N]
But for now, it is the best lead[N]
we have. And that is good enough for me.[A]
[MidRight]
I see[Beat][N]
I keep thinking about Kwame's question.[N]
Would I die to save Orodreth?[AN][CloseEyes]
Cleo[Beat] if it doesn't work[Beat][N]
I don't want to be the damned Seed![N]
I just want things to be sane again![A]
[MidLeft]
Loewe. Listen to me.[N]
There's no turning back now.[N]
You need to stop crying.[A]
[MidRight]
I just[Beat] I just want things to be normal![N]
All of this fighting and killing[Beat][N]
This isn't what I want, Cleo.[AN]
I wanted to live a simple life[N]
and have a family[Beat][N]
I thought after we liberated Decia[AN]
I'd[Beat] be able to get some land,[N]
find another way to earn a living,[N]
and[Beat] be able to tell you-[OpenEyes][A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Loewe. Shut up.[A]
[MidRight]
What[Beat] Cleo?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You think you are the only one[N]
with problems, Loewe?[N]
The only one suffering?[A]
[MidRight]
I never said that I[Beat][N]
Cleo, what is wrong?[N]
What's gotten into you?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] How can you sit here and weep[N]
when our comrades are dead, Loewe?[N]
Did they not make sacrifices?[AN]
Surely, Dragana and the others[N]
did not perish just so you could sob.[N]
Your mother, too, Loewe.[AN]
She traveled around the continent to[N]
learn about your condition and protect you.[N]
She gave her life up for you.[AN]
This is how you thank her?[N]
By moaning about how unfair[N]
your life is? Get up.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Cleo[Beat] I[Beat][N]
don't know what to do anymore![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Get up, Loewe. Stop this sad act.[N]
Crying will not save Orodreth.[N]
You understand me?[AN]
Or are you too weak to stand by[N]
your convictions and make a choice?[N]
You would rather wallow in tears?![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat] No.[N]
But I[Beat] am at a loss[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Look. I do not care what you decide.[N]
The important thing is that you get up.[N]
The important thing is that you fight.[AN]
This will not end if we lay down now.[N]
If you really are the Seed[Beat][N]
everything changes.[AN]
It is as Hamdi said. When the bells[N]
ring, you must answer the call.[N]
Do you understand me, Loewe?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] Well?[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat] I understand.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You need to be stronger if you[N]
want the life you are after, Loewe.[N]
No one is liberated without struggle.[AN]
You would do well to remember that.[N]
For everyone's sake, don't hesitate.[N]
[Beat] Not everyone gets a second chance.[A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Cleo[Beat][N]
I need to cast my feelings aside.[N]
The fallen must be avenged,[AN]
so that more lives can be saved.[N]
Whatever the cost of liberation may be[Beat][N]
I must be ready. Cleo[Beat] Thank you.[A][X]
