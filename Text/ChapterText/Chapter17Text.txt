[Left][LoadHans]
[Right][LoadIberis]
[Right]
You said you wanted to speak?[N]
I assume this is about Radnitz.[A]
[Left]
Aye, it is. I think I have an[N]
inkling of what went down, but[Beat][A]
[FarFarLeft][LoadNora][OneLineBox]
There's no proof. Am I right?[A]
[FarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Ah, Nora. Yes, that's exactly it.[AN]
I have my theory, but it isn't based on[N]
what I found, but rather what I didn't.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Around when that Loewe lad got caught[N]
with his pants down, aye? I noticed the[N]
same discrepancy during my own hunt.[AN]
There was much ink spilled during the[N]
transition of power, but somehow Cleo[N]
hardly comes up at all[Beat] Until-[A]
[FarLeft]
Until she winds up in a medical ward[N]
with a cleric healing her wounds.[AN]
She said at the time that she was[N]
wounded trying to protect Radnitz,[N]
but Kwame was supposedly there too.[AN]
Yet no records were made of these[N]
supposed attackers until after Cleo[N]
was discharged from their care.[A]
[Left]
Yes, precisely! My theory is that[N]
they hadn't figured out what their[N]
cover story was going to be yet.[AN]
The documents about the attack[N]
were all written many days after.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Sloppy, sloppy. What else can you[N]
expect from somebody as green as her?[A]
[FarRight][LoadLoewePunished][ThreeLineBox]
What's with all the hushed whispers?[AN]
You guys got some secret plans we're[N]
not allowed to be privy too?[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
L-Loewe![A]
[Left]
Nothing of the sort, sir![A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
What an absurd accusation! We're[N]
not the sneaky types. Like, at all![A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat] So, that wasn't meant to be an[N]
accusation, but it sure as hell is now.[AN]
What's going on here?[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Now, you hold your tongue, lad. We may[N]
be under your command, but you can't-[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Ahem. Iberis.[A]
[Right]
What?[A]
[Left]
I don't think he was involved.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Involved in what? Answer me. I don't[N]
like being kept in the dark like this.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
I[Beat] I don't know if we can.[AN]
Do you mind if I answer your question[N]
with one of my own, instead?[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
I do mind, but I suspect this is the[N]
best I'll get out of you three.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
How well can you really trust Cleo?[A]
[FarRight]
[Beat]What?[A]
[Right]
Hans[Beat] He's not with us.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Call it a hunch, but I think we've[N]
gotten as far as we can already.[AN]
But you, Loewe[Beat] You're important.[AN]
If there's truth to be found, you[N]
of all people are sure to find it.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Idealistic fool[Beat][A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
What on earth[Beat]? What truth?[AN]
Are you trying to turn me against one[N]
of my dearest, most trusted comrades?[A]
[Left]
I only proposed a question, Sir.[AN]
For the time being, we're on the[N]
same side, and I don't foresee[N]
that changing in the near future.[AN]
Just[Beat] Keep an ear to the ground.[A]
[FarRight]
[Beat]Bah. I don't have time for this![AN]
I'm sorry for what happened to[N]
Radnitz, truly, but we placed our[N]
trust in you; can't you do the same?[A]
[Right]
Circumstances demand we limit our[N]
partnership to a purely utilitarian[N]
one. I trust you understand why.[AN]
Until such point as we can be sure[N]
you have Freyse's best interests[N]
at heart, this is our position.[A]
[FarRight]
Then I suppose this conversation[N]
isn't going to go anywhere.[AN]
I have a meeting to get to.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
You're a damned fool, Hans. If this[N]
conversation reaches Cleo's ears-[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
It won't. I have faith.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Perhaps you will extend that same[N]
faith to the Decian's headsman?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Bah. What's done is done.[AN]
All we can do now is hope Hans is[N]
right, and that Loewe truly is[N]
unaware of what really happened.[A][X]

[FarRight][LoadCatrin]
[FarFarRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[FarFarRight][MoveRight]
[Right]
Sorry I'm late. I got, uh[Beat][N]
waylaid, so to speak.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Don't trouble yourself; you are here[N]
now, and so we may begin in earnest.[AN]
Tell us, what is your decision?[A]
[Right]
Well[Beat] there's a part of me that[N]
wants to go to Chouwouj, however[Beat][AN]
The journey is long, and Mahemen needs[N]
our help today, not tomorrow.[AN]
Since we are already within its[N]
borders, we should focus our efforts,[AN]
taking the fight to Cythes while we[N]
still have an established presence[N]
in the region. So[Beat] we stay.[A]
[FarRight]
But Loewe, if we don't act now, we may[N]
lose our best shot at Taraji![AN]
If she catches wind of the Liberation[N]
mobilizing against the Immortals, she[N]
could go underground, and disappear![A]
[Right]
I know. But the same can be said for[N]
Mureib, and[Beat] I feel like we can[N]
convince Mureib to help us willingly.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Convincing Mureib to help[Beat] it[N]
won't be easy, but we can always try.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
We have to try. He's our ally, after[N]
all; we can't just betray him after he[N]
placed his faith in us, can we?[A]
[FarLeft]
But if he refuses, we won't have a[N]
choice in the matter. You can't[N]
hesitate if that comes to pass, Loewe.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
I know, Cleo. I won't hesitate.[A]
[FarLeft]
Good![A] Good[Beat][A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Then it is settled. We will return[N]
to Telyada at once, and seek an[N]
audience with Mureib. Any objections?[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Mine. If you plan to return to Mureib,[N]
then I will hunt for Taraji alone.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
What? Wait, but-[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'm not going to let her get away.[AN]
If you won't help me, Loewe, then[Beat][N]
then I'll just have to find her myself.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Wait, Mother! Come back![A]
[FarRight][LoadBoro]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Leave her be, kid. She's got a score[N]
to settle with that woman, after all.[AN]
Vengeance is a powerful motivator.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
I-Indeed[Beat][A]
[FarLeft]
And you, Boro? Will you be joining us?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
I said I would, didn't I? I'm no flake.[AN]
If the plan is to take the fight to[N]
the Cytheans, then I'm with you.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[Right][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadElias]
[Right][LoadCoralia]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
What about you, Elias?[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
I'll go where Coralia goes, for now.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Right[Beat] I think we should stay here.[AN]
Without your support, an excursion[N]
to Cythes would be[Beat] ill-advised.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
I agree. You'll be safer with us.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[Right][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
We should make preparations to depart.[AN]
Cleo, Loewe, I trust you two are ready?[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
I sure am. But you, Loewe? Are you-[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'll be fine, Cleo. I have a plan.[N]
It's like you told me[Beat][AN]
Now's the time to struggle, and fight,[N]
and claim liberty with our own hands.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Well said, Loewe.[A]
[FarLeft]
Yes[Beat] Well said, indeed[Beat][A][X]

[Right][LoadKwame]
[FarRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Thank you for attending to us so soon,[N]
Mureib. I was worried we may be made[N]
to wait for quite some time to speak.[A]
[MidLeft]
Nonsense. Your arrival could not have[N]
been more timely if it was planned.[AN]
We're planning an offensive on the[N]
morrow to push back the Cytheans and[N]
reclaim some key defensive positions.[AN]
Your assistance would be invaluable.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
On the morrow, you say? How fortuitous![A]
[FarRight]
What would you have us do, Archbishop?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
There is a fort, located at the mouth[N]
of the Kasira river. A high ranking[N]
Cythean general is posted there;[AN]
Normally, he would be beyond our reach.[N]
We had planned to flush him out by[N]
claiming the surrounding territory,[AN]
but with your people acting as a strike[N]
force of sorts, you may be able to[N]
accomplish what my forces could not.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Hmmm[Beat] It seems risky. How can we-?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
We'll do it. If it helps to beat back[N]
the Cythean invasion, there's no risk[N]
too great. We'll depart immediately.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
E-er, yes, indeed. I suppose this is[N]
to be a particularly short meeting, then?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I suppose it is. Stay safe, Lord Athan.[AN]

Alright, we've made it. Looks like the[N]
battle has already started elsewhere[N]
along the front lines[Beat][A]
[Right]
Indeed. The Mahemeni are counting on[N]
us to succeed here, today. I pray we[N]
are prepared for the battle ahead?[A]
[FarRight]
Of course. We should stay on our[N]
toes though; [Red]The battle may[N]
not end when we take the fort.[Red][AN]
This is a battlefield on a scale we[N]
haven't been involved in ever before;[AN]
anything could happen out there.[A]

Hey there! Do you happen to know the[N]
directions to, uh[Beat] what was it[Beat]?[AN]
"The Front Lines" or something?[AN]
The Archbishop sent me to come help[N]
with some kind of battle, but I think[N]
I'm all sorts of lost right now.[AN]
Oh, wait! Hang on! You've got weapons[N]
and stuff, so does that mean[Beat]?[AN]
Hah, Nikolas, you crazy dastard, you've[N]
done it again! You guys are totally[N]
the people I was sent to meet with![AN]
In that case, my orders are to "help[N]
eliminate any and all resistance to[N]
the Decian's assault on the fort."[AN]
Sounds easy-peasy to me! But, uh[Beat][AN]
What fort d'you think he meant? Hmmm[Beat][A][X]

Did you truly think me such a fool as[N]
to not know what your plans were?[AN]
To come into my domain, wielding that[N]
blade, feigning an offering of peace?[AN]
Decian Liberators, now is the twilight[N]
of your struggle! Lay down your arms,[N]

Refuse, and you will instead be[N]
granted an end befitting a warrior![A][X]

If this is to be your gambit, Mureib,[N]
then I answer it with one of my own.[AN]
It has been many centuries since last[N]
I took to the field of battle, but my[N]
skills have never once waned.[AN]
Mahemen![A] You face the power of a dead[N]
empire, made manifest in I, Athanasius![AN]

I am an immortal! It'll take more[N]
than that to kill me, Decians![A]
[MidRight]
We need not kill you to defeat you,[N]
old friend. I've spent a thousand years[N]
preparing for this possibility;[AN]
Let us see if you can withstand the[N]
might of the most ancient of magics![A][X]

Gah[Beat] I was careless[Beat][A]
[Right]
It's over, Mureib! You're outmatched![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Yes[Beat] I suppose I am. Very well.[AN]
I surrender. You may carry out what[N]
treachery you'd been planning.[A]
[FarRight]
Damn you, Mureib, we didn't want to[N]
fight you! We wanted to work with[N]
you, to save Mahemen[Beat][AN]
To save Orodreth![A]
[MidLeft]
You came here to ask me to die.[AN]
Any help you offered was merely to[N]
soften the blow of your true aim.[AN]
I am no fool, Son of Catrin. I saw[N]
the writing on the wall the first[N]
time I saw you in Athan's charge.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Athan[Beat]?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Mureib, old friend, you and I[N]
both know what grim tidings[N]
the wind has carried to our world.[AN]
We've lived long; our time is come.[AN]
Please, do not presume to fight[N]
the tides of fate so.[A]
[MidLeft]
Better to die, now that to do so[N]
is convenient to you all, is it?[AN]
I will not submit to you. Not for[N]
these sad and pitiful folk.[A]
[FarRight]
But[Beat] How can you say that?[AN]
What's one life in the face[N]
of the entire world? Of whole[N]
families, whole empires even!?[A]
[MidLeft]
Hah, is that what they tell you[N]
to believe, Seed of Byelen?[AN]
It's true; one man is little[N]
in the face of one world.[AN]
But you think small; you are not[N]
unmoored, as I am, from this[Beat][AN]
this pettiest of perspectives.[A]
[FarRight]
So you'd damn them all to die,[N]
just to preserve your immortal[N]
life? How can you be so selfish!?[A]
[MidLeft]
You think me selfish? You ask me[N]
to give of myself all that I have[N]
such that your world might live.[AN]
Have you never stopped to consider[N]
that perhaps yours is not the[N]
first time a world has ended here?[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
What?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I am old, Loewe. Older than those[N]
tallest of trees, of those most[N]
towering of snow-capped mountains.[AN]
I've lived more lives than yours[N]
has ever touched. This is only[N]
one of hundreds of my lives.[AN]
And this world, too, is but one[N]
of a hundred worlds.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
What is this nonsense, Mureib?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I was a farmer, with a wife and two[N]
beautiful young children. Ali and[N]
Turo were their names. Ah, yes[Beat][AN]
I loved them so. But when the[N]
locals took note of my ageless[N]
form, they called me a monster.[AN]
When I saw our home, in flames,[N]
surrounded by a mob of faces I had[N]
known so well for so many years[Beat][AN]
Yes, that was the end of the world.[AN]
And then, I was a soldier in a war[N]
between a lord and his despot of a[N]
brother. The lord and I were in love.[AN]
But the war was not ours to win.[AN]
When I saw his corpse, dangling from[N]
the gallows, a ghoulish display at[N]
which all the children did laugh[Beat][AN]
That, too, was the end of the world.[AN]
When I watched my friends grow old[N]
and die around me, unable to join[N]
them in their journey unto death;[AN]
When I witnessed yet another empire[N]
rise, grow, prosper, wither, and die;[AN]
When I had to abandon yet another[N]
family, yet another home, yet[N]
another life, to the march of time[Beat][AN]
I've seen the world end, time and[N]
time again. It is simply the way[N]
of things. I wish not to fight it.[A]
[Right]
[Beat] I[Beat] I know your pain well.[AN]
But don't you wish to see this cycle of[N]
self-annihilation and rebirth ended?[A]
[MidLeft]
No.[AN]
This world does not deserve the mercy[N]
all worlds before it were denied.[AN]
There will be life after death, and[N]
I will still be here to see it.[A][X]

[Beat] What a load of bull.[AN]
Your nihilism may help you excuse[N]
your apathy, but it's just that;[AN]
an excuse to keep your own[N]
personal status quo intact.[AN]
So what if this world will end[N]
one day regardless of our fight?[AN]
Our value isn't found in our[N]
deaths, but in the lives we live![AN]
You're willing to forsake tens of[N]
thousands of lives just to keep[N]
your sense of fatalism intact,[AN]
because you know, deep down,[N]
you've wasted all your hundreds[N]
of lives, living always in fear;[AN]
so afraid of the end that awaits[N]
you, of the tragedy that may strike,[AN]
that you can't even recognize the[N]
inherent value in being able to live[N]
those lives enough to mourn them.[A]

[Beat] I suppose you fancy yourself[N]

You could never grasp the depths[N]
of so many cumulative sorrows,[N]
echoing across milennia.[AN]
They sacrificed an empire to[N]
create us, boy! An empire![AN]
They left us to sift through the[N]
corpses of a thousand thousand[N]
souls, to be forever haunted![AN]
You know nothing of what we saw![A]
[FarRight]
And you'd let it all happen again,[N]
just so you could say you earned[N]
all your self-loathing misery?[A]
[MidLeft]
We are the only ones who remember[N]
the worlds that came before yours.[AN]
If we die, so too will everyone[N]
who lives on in our memories.[AN]
That's what life is all about;[AN]
persisting beyond the brink, for[N]
all the souls that made you you.[A]
[FarRight]
No! I'm[Beat] I'm sick of hearing that![AN]
The dead don't want us to live for them![N]
They want you to live for the people[N]
they left behind in their passing![AN]

only in a life well and fully lived.[AN]

Killing you[Beat]? But I thought[Beat][AN]
I thought it was made to keep[N]
my body stable. Mother said-[A]
[MidLeft]
"Mother said?" How quaint. And naive.[AN]
It's a sword, Loewe. Swords kill. Or[N]
did you truly believe your mother[N]
somehow knew how to create such a tool?[AN]
That your mother could somehow bind[N]
the power of a god with a trinket?[AN]
She is an admirable swordswoman, but[N]
she is nothing more than that.[AN]
The blade is not much younger than I,[N]
forged in the blood of an immortal.[AN]

For this express purpose.[A]

But that's-![A]

When you strike me down with this[N]
blade, I will die, as you know it.[AN]
But the magic of the ritual cannot[N]
be nullified, only circumvented.[AN]
For that purpose, the sword acts as[N]
a sepulchre for immortal souls,[AN]
entombing us within its steel[N]
for the rest of our unending[N]
sentences; forevermore.[AN]
Even should the sword one day be[N]
shattered, ground to dust, burned to[N]
ash, we will live on in the embers.[AN]
Immaterial. Eternal. And painfully,[N]
painfully, so painfully aware of it all.[A]

That sword of yours[Beat] it was made-[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
If I hadn't done as you asked of me[Beat][AN]
If I had chosen to spare him after all[Beat][AN]
What would you have done, Kwame?[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
I would have[Beat] respected your decision.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Is that true? Or just a placation?[AN]
What about you, Cleo?[A]
[Left]
I would have taken the sword right[N]
out of your hands and done it myself.[AN]
We aren't going to be afforded the[N]
luxury of sentimentality in this war.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That[Beat] would not have worked.[AN]
The blade must be wielded by Loewe.[N]
Otherwise, its powers are inert.[A]
[MidRight]
So you need me for this, too, then?[AN]
To kill for the plan[Beat][N]
To die for it[Beat][AN]
Do I even have the power to change[N]
this course fate has set for me?[A]
[Left]
Please, I think we've all had quite[N]
enough of the pontificating.[AN]
Loewe, are you ready to depart?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Damn it all[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]

[Left]
L-Loewe? Where are you going?[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Go after him. I will remain here, and[N]
make sure we're prepared to leave.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Right, of course. I'll be back soon.[A][X]

Loewe! What the hell's gotten into you!?[A]
[MidRight]
Cleo[Beat][OpenEyes] Of course, you would follow me.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Well, somebody had to! You just took off[N]
running like a madman! What's with you?[A]
[MidRight]
[CloseEyes][Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]We're friends, right, Cleo?[A]
[MidLeft]
Huh? Of course we are. After all[N]
we've been through together[Beat][AN]
How could we be anything less?[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Would you keep a secret, even from[N]
your friends? Even from me?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Where are you going with this, Loewe?[A]
[MidRight]
Answer the question.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat] I would. If it meant keeping that[N]
friend safe[Beat] I would do anything[A]
[MidRight]
I see.[AN]
[Beat][AN]
What happened to Radnitz?[A]
[MidLeft]
Radnitz[Beat] was killed by Selesian[N]
prisoners, who were awaiting execution.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
What[Beat] really happened?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Loewe, you don't want to have this talk.[AN]
I can see it writ plain upon your face;[N]
anything I say now will only hurt you.[A]
[MidRight]
Damn it, Cleo, answer me![AN]
You[Beat] Kwame[Beat] My own mother[Beat][AN]
Even Byelen himself[Beat] All of you[Beat][AN]
I'm not a pawn in your games! I'm sick[N]
of the lies, of the manipulation![AN]
So tell me[Beat] Please[Beat][AN]
Tell me it wasn't you, Cleo[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight]
CLEO![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I killed him, Loewe. I killed Radnitz,[N]
and I killed Epony, too.[AN]
When we arrived in Freyse, we were[N]
deceived; made to kill innocents in[N]
Radnitz's name. Had I not acted,[AN]
there's no telling what he would[N]
have done. He could have used that[N]
information as leverage against us,[AN]
or worse, pinned the crime on the[N]
Liberation to take control of Decia.[AN]
Even if he had not, his hands were[N]
stained in blood, and that blood has[N]
seeped into our own legacy as well.[AN]
He was a threat to everything that[N]
we all hold so dear. And that's why[Beat][AN]
I killed him before he could strike.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You have your answers, Loewe.[AN]
Are you satisfied, now? I only kept[N]
this info secret for your own good.[AN]
Does it please you to have learned[N]
the truth? Or do you want-[A]

Enough! You want a fight so damn bad?[N]
Then I'll give you one, you dastard![A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
There's that resolve you're so[N]
fond of demanding of me[Beat][AN]
Show me how you fight, Cleo![AN]
Your tongue may lie, but that axe[N]
of yours has always sung true![A][X]

Is this what you wanted!?[AN]
After all we've accomplished!?[A][X]

## Ch17_DuelText2
[SetName]Loewe [NL]
You told me to stand strong.[AN]
To stand by my convictions.[AN]
Well, here I am![AN]
I thought I knew you, Cleo![AN]
I thought I could trust you, that[N]
you would never go behind my back.[AN]
But I was wrong, wasn't I?[N]
You're nothing but another liar![A][X]

## Ch17_DuelText3
[SetName] Cleo [NL]
I did what needed to be done![AN]
It might not have been pretty,[N]
heroic, or noble, but it was just![AN]
Can't you see I did this for the[N]
sake of the Liberation?[AN]
I dirtied my hands so yours could[N]
remain clean; so we would survive![A][X]

## Ch17_DuelText4
[SetName]Loewe [NL]
Dragana wouldn't kill like that;[AN]
a man in search of redemption![AN]
He deserved better than that![AN]
He deserved a second chance![A][X]

Killed his own people, robbed them![AN]

such a fiend of a man?[A][X]

## Ch17_DuelText6
[SetName]Loewe [NL]
There had to be another way![AN]
If you had spoken to me, asked[N]
how I felt, we'd have found it![AN]
But instead, your first instinct[N]
was to lie, to act without me![AN]
That's now how you treat a friend;[AN]
that's how you treat a tool![AN]
Is that all I am to you? a sword[N]
to unsheathe when I'm needed!?[AN]
Tell me why, Cleo![AN]
Why do this!?[A][X]

I[Beat] I was taught[Beat] to be ruthless.[AN]
To give no quarter, to never hesitate.[AN]
Dragana made me who I am today, but she[N]
couldn't unmake who I already was.[AN]
Byelen knows she tried her damnedest[Beat][AN]
She always said there was a part[N]
of me I could not see, and that[Beat][AN]
That it shone so bright[Beat][AN]
But she was wrong. Now that she's gone,[N]
I'm[Beat] right back to my old tricks.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Cleo[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Hah[Beat] She would be so mad at us[N]
right now, fighting like this.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
She never did like when we'd quarrel.[AN]
"You brats keep that racket up, you'll[N]
wake the damn Emperor himself!"[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] We will avenge her. We have to.[AN]
But[Beat] promise me you'll turn out[N]
better than I did, when this is over.[AN]
Dragana deserves somebody worthy to[N]
carry her legacy[Beat] don't you think?[A]
[MidRight]
I can't promise that, Cleo. Dragana[N]
left her legacy in both our hands.[AN]
If we want to make her proud[Beat] we[N]
should start with not fighting anymore.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] You said it yourself. She was[N]
more a mother to you than me, no matter[N]
how I may feel about her personally.[AN]
After all the things I've done[Beat][AN]
She could have left me to die that day,[N]
but she didn't. I'm still here. Why?[A]
[MidRight]
I can't tell you what Dragana thought.[AN]
But[Beat] I know I wouldn't want to face[N]
this war without you by my side.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
But[Beat] But I just-[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You did what you thought was right.[AN]
I can't say I wouldn't have done the[N]
same if our positions were swapped[Beat][N]
but I would never have lied to you.[AN]
Promise me this is the last time[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
Of course[Beat] I swear it. If I had[N]
known[Beat] that is to say, I only[N]
meant to[Beat] I just wanted to-[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Cleo.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
We should get back. I bet Kwame is[N]
worried sick about us right about now.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
You're right! I totally forgot[Beat][A]
[MidRight]
By the way[Beat] how was my sword arm?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
To be frank? It was terrible! I could[N]
have dodged your swings all day![A]
[MidRight]
Oh come on, it wasn't that bad. I got[N]
pretty close on that second swing![A]

So you've chosen to abandon the boy?[AN]
Tut, tut, Catrin. I expected better![A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat] I suppose I should have expected[N]
that even here, in the open sea, you[N]
would find a way to haunt me still.[A]
[Right]
Come now, Catrin. Not even a hello?[N]
That's no way to speak to an old[N]
flame, is it? We used to be so close![A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
What do you want with me this time?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Oh, nothing! I'm just checking in on[N]
one of my most valued friends.[AN]
You know, they say that even the most[N]
brilliant of trees will wither and[N]
fall if it is left untended for long.[AN]
And my, what a brilliant tree you are.[AN]
But then I must wonder why you do not[N]
tend to your son so dilligently as[N]
I tend to you? How curious indeed[Beat][A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
I will not be lectured by the likes[N]
of you on what to do with our son.[A]
[Right]
Your son, Catrin. I merely gave him[N]
unto you, as was our accord.[AN]
That man, whatever his name was, you[N]
told me he was the REAL father, yes?[AN]
But still[Beat] that's thrice now that[N]
you've forsaken the poor kid.[AN]
Does he scare you, Catrin?[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Nothing scares me, least of all you.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Yes, indeed, the unflappable Grimblade.[AN]
I suppose the whole costume must really[N]
help you disguise the way your shoulders[N]
tense up when the dread sets in[Beat][AN]
But make no mistake, Catrin. I see you.[AN]
I know exactly how afraid you are of[N]
what's going to happen to him. It's[N]
palpable. And quite embarrassing.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Did you come here just to gloat?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
No, of course not! I came here to help![AN]
I heard you were hunting for the great[N]
undying Taraji. I know you have a score[N]
to settle with her, after all[Beat][AN]
As my dearest, and perhaps only, friend[N]
in this topsy turvy world, I figured[N]
I owed it to you to lend my aid.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
No.[AN]
I don't want your help. I want you[N]
to get the hell out of my life.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Taraji will tear you apart, and you[N]
know it. You knew that before you[N]
ever set foot on this boat.[AN]
You knew I would take notice of your[N]
departure; that I would come to grant[N]
you aid; to grant you my power.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
It'll be just like old times, eh?[N]
