Ha! I win again. No one can[N]
beat me in hide and seek![A]

Grr[Beat] Don't get so full of[N]
yourself! I coulda won, easy![A]
[Left]
Let's play again tomorrow, Loewe.[N]
I'm not ready to give up yet![A]
[MidRight]
Well, alright. We'll meet up again,[N]

[MidRight][LoadLoeweKid]
[MidLeft][LoadLoeweMom][OneLineBox]
Loewe! Are you done playing?[A]
[MidRight]
Yeah, all my friends went home.[A]
[MidLeft]
Then it's time for sword practice![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Do I have to, Mom? It's not like[N]
I need to fight. I'm just a kid.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You never know when that may change.[N]
We're safe here in Decia, but[Beat][N]
who knows how long that'll last?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Why? Are the Cytheans gonna attack?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Maybe. They've been preoccupied with[N]
Mahemen recently, though. Your dad and[N]
I barely made it out of there in time.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]So I have to learn to defend myself,[N]
just in case? I guess that makes sense.[A]
[MidLeft]
Good. You have a long way to go before[N]
you can survive with your own strength.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You and Dad are here,[N]
so I don't have to, right?[N]
You're not going away?[A]
[MidLeft]
Of course not. Now, back to your[N]
training! If you do well, I'll try to[N]
convince Dad to make your favorite.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
A-Apple pie?! Alright,[N]
I won't hold anything back![A]
[MidLeft]
Ha, that's the spirit.[N]
Let's see what you've got![A][X]

No[Beat] Mom! Dad![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[Event]
[MidRight][LoadLoeweKid]
Is anyone here?[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[Event]
[MidRight][LoadLoeweKid]
If you can hear me, say something![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[Event]
[MidRight][LoadLoeweKid]
Please[Beat] Don't leave me alone![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[Event]
[MidRight][LoadLoeweKid]
[MidLeft][LoadDragana][ThreeLineBox]
What a dreadful scene[Beat] How did you[N]
manage to survive on your own until[N]
until we found you in the forest?[A]
[MidRight]
I got away. My mom and dad[N]
told me to run[Beat] and I[Beat][N]
I just left them. I'm a coward![A]
[MidLeft]
You're alive, and that's what matters.[N]
The Cytheans razed this place to the[N]
ground, and naught but soil remains.[AN]
Had you stayed, you would have only[N]
died along with the other villagers.[A]
[MidRight]
You don't know that! My mom's real[N]
tough, so I'm sure that they're[N]
still alive. They have to be.[A]
[MidLeft]
It's better if you accept the truth[N]
now. Even after seeing your home in[N]
ashes, you still believe they're safe?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] [Beat][A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Do you have any relatives that[N]
can take you in, for now?[A]
[MidRight]
No, I don't. My mom and dad fled here[N]
from Mahemen, so I've got no one else.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I see[Beat] in that case, why don't you[N]
come with me? I can offer you food[N]
and shelter, at the very least.[A]
[MidRight]
I have nowhere to go, so just until[N]
I find my parents[Beat] I'll go with you.[N]
Actually, who are you people, anyway?[A]
[MidLeft]
We are the Decian Liberators, those[N]
brave enough to resist the Cythean[N]
occupation of our homeland. As for me,[AN]
I am their leader, Dragana Kasun.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Can you teach me how to fight,[N]
then? How to become one of you?[A]
[MidLeft]
It would be many years before I even[N]
consider letting you on a battlefield.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Yeah, I figured[Beat] I know I'm weak.[N]
Stil, when I think about what[N]
happened to my home and friends[Beat][AN]
When I think of those dastards[N]
getting away with this, I can't[N]
just wait and watch it happen.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I'll consider it. For now, we should[N]
escape the flames and head to our base.[N]
Ah, right. What's your name, boy?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
It's Loewe[Beat] Hold on, I[N]
see something in the rubble.[A]
[Event]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Hm? What is it, Loewe?[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]A sword. It belonged to my mother.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I see. Is it too heavy for you to[N]
carry? I can hold on to it for now.[A]
[MidRight]
No, that's fine. Keeping it safe[N]
is up to me now. Let's just go.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Right. Follow me, then.[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadSvetomir][OneLineBox]
Hey! Are you ignoring me?[A]
[MidRight]
What do you want?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Come on, there's no need to be[N]
so cold. We're cell buddies![A]
[MidRight]
Buddy isn't a word I'd use to[N]
describe a pestering priest.[AN]
If you don't need anything,[N]
then leave me alone, got it?[A]
[MidLeft]
Well, you seemed deep in thought, so[N]
I thought you may not have heard it.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Heard what?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Down the hall, it sounded like weapons[N]
clashing to me. Maybe we've got some[N]
rescuers coming to free us? I hope so.[A]
[MidRight]
Can't imagine any other reason someone[N]
would break into these musty dungeons,[N]
which means she got my message after all.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
She? Who is that supposed to be?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You'll see soon enough. For now,[N]
get ready to escape if you want[N]
to live to see tomorrow, priest.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Heh, you don't have to tell me[N]
twice. I'm ready when you are![A][X]



## BeginningSceneCleoGroupText

[Left][LoadMira]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadEmil]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
We've finally made it. Even with Loewe's[N]
information, Duke Cibor's manse has[N]
more powerful defenses than I expected.[AN]
Freeing the general may prove difficult.[A]
[Left]
The fool even got himself captured for[N]
this[Beat] Well, at least his dragon made[N]
it back to us. Thanks to that luck,[AN]
we may still have a chance at rescuing[N]
Dragana. Iskra, Emil, are you sure[N]
you're ready? You're still green.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Ready as I'll ever be, Mom. You need[N]
everyone you can get, right? Plus,[AN]
I've gotta give Loewe a piece of my[N]
mind for saddling me with this sword.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Even if our odds are low, we have to[N]
try. Without the general, we never[N]
would have made it this far, right?[A]
[Left]
Indeed. First though, we should[N]
break Loewe out of his cell. We'll need[N]
every capable fighter we can get.[AN]
After that, we'll have to go deeper[N]
into the dungeons to find our general.[A]
[Right]
Mm[Beat] with stealth off the table, every[N]
guard here is coming for our heads.[N]
We must move with haste to succeed.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Then let us go. Cleo, I expect you to[N]
call the shots from here on out.[AN]
The general entrusted you with strategic[N]
considerations in the main unit, did she not?[A]
[Right]
Yes, Captain Mira. Loewe and[N]
I served as her adjutants.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Consider the recon unit at your[N]
disposal, then. Iskra, Emil, I[N]
trust you have no problem with this?[A]
[FarLeft]
No objections. Just use us well,[N]
Cleo. We've lost too many of[N]
our allies to falter here.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Right. All of our hopes are riding on[N]
this mission, so there's no going back.[A]
[Right]
I will do my utmost to match your[N]
expectations. Let us begin the operation![A][X]



## AlenaSpawnText
[MidLeft][LoadAlena]
[Right][LoadAlenaGrunt1]
[FarRight][LoadAlenaGrunt2]
Do you hear that, Alena? Looks like[N]
the fighting's gotten underway.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Seems so. Well, you know the score.[N]
The duke's paying us well for this[N]
job, so we'll have to earn our keep.[A]
[Right]
You got it, boss. A day's work in[N]
gold is waiting for us! Let's get[N]
this over with and hit the tavern.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Like I give a damn about that[Beat] Once[N]
I find Svet, we'll break out of here[N]
and leave that to fools like you two.[AN]
Though I suppose Cidor will hunt me[N]
down after that[Beat] what a nuisance.[A][X]


## BoroSpawnText
[MidRight][LoadBoro][ThreeLineBox]
There's still a fight going on?[N]
Looks like the Liberators didn't[N]
send their best to save Dragana.[AN]
Only fools would keep fighting for[N]
a cause as sorry and lost as this,[N]
instead of accumulating gold instead.[AN]
Well, I'm not one of them anymore,[N]
so I don't need to hold back.[N]
Can't say I want to kill old comrades,[AN]
but if any of them meet my spear, then[N]
they can only blame their misfortune![A][X]



## LoeweIskraTalkCh1Text
[MidLeft][LoadIskra]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
Iskra, I'm glad you're safe.[N]
Do you still have my sword?[A]
[MidLeft]
Of course I do. You entrusted it to[N]
me, so there's no way I'd lose it.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Thanks. I knew I could count on you.[A][ToggleSmile]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I don't want your gratitude, Loewe.[N]
Just don't make another plan risky[N]
enough where you'd need to do this.[AN]
You could have died, you know that?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I'll do what I must to free Dragana,[N]
so I can't promise to take less risks.[A]
[MidLeft]
You plan to repay the general[N]
for saving you by risking death?[AN]
Surely you realize she wouldn't[N]
want that. You're family, right?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You're not wrong, and that's all[N]
the more reason for my actions.[N]
I[Beat] We can't lose anyone else.[A]
[MidLeft]
I agree, which is why you need to[N]
tell me that you won't die like a fool.[N]
Otherwise, I'm not giving the sword.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]You know how to twist my arm.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Of course. I've learned[N]
that much over the years.[A][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]
Fine, I won't take any unnecessary[N]
risks. Is that good enough for you?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I suppose it'll do. Here, take it.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Finally! Feels good to have[N]
his back in my hands. Now, let's-[A]
[MidLeft]
Hold on. If you don't mind me asking[Beat][N]
Can you teach me how to use a sword?[AN]
I want to be able to defend myself,[N]
even if I'm unable to use my magic.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'm not sure how helpful I'll be. My[N]
mother taught me, but she died before[N]
I learned much beyond the basics.[AN]
Looking back now, her swordmanship was[N]
peerless. A pride of Mahemen, no doubt.[A]
[MidLeft]
Mahemen[Beat] All that desert must help[N]
keep the Cytheans at bay. Their rebels[N]
are in a much better position than us.[AN]
Maybe if we all joined hands, our[N]
forces could send the Cytheans packing.[A]
[MidRight]
Perhaps[Beat] Maybe a swordmaster there[N]
could help finish my training. Right[N]
now, my sword is of use to no one.[A]
[MidLeft]
I've seen you practicing on[N]
your own sometimes, though.[N]
You look pretty good to me.[A]
[MidRight]
Against a practice target, sure. When[N]
I'm facing a real person with one,[N]
there's a[Beat] sense of hesitation.[AN]
Still, if you really want to learn,[N]
then I can show you a thing or two.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Ha, I'm glad you agreed. Wouldn't[N]
want to twist your other arm too.[A][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]
Yeah, yeah, get moving. We've[N]
wasted enough time talking, Iskra.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Coarse as ever[Beat] I hope he's a[N]
bit nicer as a teacher, at least.[A][X]



## EmilCleoTalkCh1Text
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][LoadEmil][ThreeLineBox]
Oh, uh, hey there, Cleo! I just[N]
wanted to ask you something.[N]
It'll be quick, I promise.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Very well. Emil, was it? Ask[N]
away, but please make it quick.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Well, is it true that you're from the[N]
Cythean Empire? I'm just curious since[N]
I'm from there too, believe it or not.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
That I am. I didn't expect I'd meet[N]
another deserter. What's your hometown?[A]
[MidRight]
Just a small village close to the[N]
border of Decia. What about you?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I was born in Gechrysos.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
The capital? Wow, you[N]
must've been rich.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I cannot deny it. My family used our[N]
wealth to give me a stellar education[N]
at a military academy in the city.[AN]
They meant to raise me as the perfect,[N]
honorable officer of the Cythean Empire,[N]
just as my elder brother was before me.[AN]
Of course, that didn't turn out well.[A]
[MidRight]
I'd bet you're from a military family,[N]
then. Y'know, a guy from one of those[N]
was the reason I signed up for this war.[AN]
I met the general here, Elias Argymos.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
R-Really? How did that happen?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
One day, he came into my town looking[N]
for recruits. Looking at him was like[N]
seeing a hero from a bedtime story.[AN]
The model Cythean soldier, fighting for[N]
his country[Beat] With a man like that[N]
leading the occupation, it seemed just.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]And then you came here and saw the[N]
truth for your own eyes, as I did.[N]
That we were lied to, about everything.[A]
[MidRight]
Yeah[Beat] I'd only trained for a week[N]
before I defected from my squad.[N]
They chased me down, but thankfully,[AN]
Mira and the recon unit saved me.[N]
How did you end up on this side?[A]
[MidLeft]
I received a commissioned position[N]
based off of my family name, mostly.[N]
For a time, I followed my orders,[AN]
but the guilt became too much to bear.[AN]
When I came across General Dragana,[N]
I surrendered immediately to her,[N]
expecting I'd soon meet my death.[AN]
Instead, she let me live. I mean to[N]
repay that mercy in any way that I can.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
That's all we can do now[Beat] Sorry, that[N]
ended up taking longer than I thought.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Yes, we should focus on the mission.[N]
However, it was helpful, discussing[N]
this with someone else who understands.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Agreed. Well, I'll go on ahead, Cleo.[N]
Maybe we can talk some other time![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Argymos[Beat] So Emil met my brother?[N]
If I continue on this path, then[N]
I may have to see him again soon[Beat][A][X]

## SvetomirAlenaTalkCh1Text
[MidLeft][LoadAlena]
[MidRight][LoadSvetomir][OneLineBox]
Alena?! What are you doing here?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I took on a job from Cidor to stop[N]
any escapees down here. Now, let's-[A]
[MidRight]
So[Beat] it's finally come to this[Beat][N]
Fine then, have at you, knave![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Let me finish. I'm here to break you[N]
out, moron. Besides, how are you going[N]
to fight me with just that staff?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I have my ways[Beat] Well, that's good.[N]
You wouldn't want to cross a holy man.[A]
[MidLeft]
Sure[Beat] Let's just get out of here[N]
while the rebels distract the guards.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Sorry, but I can't do that. Turns out[N]
their general is locked up in here,[N]
and they need someone to heal them.[AN]
I finally have the chance to help free[N]
our people, and I won't let it pass by.[A]
[MidLeft]
Come on, use your head. We lost years[N]
ago, when Duke Cidor waved the white[N]
flag and welcomed the Cythean Empire.[AN]
Joining up with the half-dead scraps[N]
of the Liberators is a death sentence![A]
[MidRight]
Can you say that you're satisfied[N]
running away for the rest of your life?[N]
The duke'll give you a bounty for this.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Of course not. I don't enjoy seeing[N]
them in charge anymore than you.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Then join us! If any part of you wants[N]
to see this land freed from its chains,[N]
then please heed my words, Alena.[AN]
We may be down, but there are still[N]
cards left to play. Don't give up hope[N]
for the return of the Decia we knew![A]
[MidLeft]
You've resorted to begging? Well, you[N]
must really be serious[Beat] Alright,[N]
I get it. Even if this is stupid,[AN]
even if it means we're just going to[N]
die, to hell with it. I'm with you.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I knew you'd see things my way![N]
Well then, milady, after you.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Still hiding behind me, eh Svet?[N]
I guess some things don't change[Beat][N]
Fine then. I'll carve a path for you![A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadCleo][OneLineBox]
Loewe! I'm glad you're alright.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
They roughed me up a bit, but[N]
I'll survive. Where's Lumi?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Some members of the recon unit are[N]
watching over our mounts, so she's[N]
with them. Here, I brought you a bow.[A]
[Right]
Thanks. By the way, did you find out[N]
where Dragana is? The guards wouldn't[N]
say a word about it when I asked.[A]
[MidLeft]
From the few we've interrogated, she's[N]
deeper in the dungeons. I couldn't[N]
find her exact location, however.[A]
[Right]
Then we have to get a move on, quickly.[N]
If it comes to it, we may need to leave[N]
behind some of our allies, as well.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
What are you saying? How are we[N]
supposed to continue on without them?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
It would be difficult, but if we have[N]
no other choice, then [Red]at least the two[N]
of us have to live to see another day.[Red][AN]
Rescuing Dragana is our top priority,[N]
and we can't afford to fail, Cleo.[A]
[MidLeft]
It won't come to that.[Red] I'll make sure[N]
everyone else escapes before us.[Red][N]
That way, no one will be captured.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
I hope it does go that easily. Still,[N]
we have to be prepared for anything.[A]
[FarRight][LoadSvetomir]
Uh, hello there. Sorry to butt in, but[N]
are you two a part of the resistance?[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
That we are. And who are you?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'm Svetomir, a priest of Vetheim, a[N]
town at the foot of the duke's manse.[N]
I organized a protest against him,[AN]
but he threw me and my fellows in[N]
prison the moment he found out.[N]
You have my thanks for freeing me.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Well, you're safe now. You should[N]
leave while you still can, priest.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Wait! I'm a fairly capable healer.[N]
If you let me join you and give me[N]
a staff, I can mend your wounds.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
You mean to become one of us?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
I've spent my days hoping Byelen would[N]
hear my prayers[Beat] That he would strike[N]
down the invaders and save our country.[AN]
However, I now understand his answer.[N]
I must take matters into my own hands.[N]
If it'll help you chase out the Cytheans,[AN]
then I'll do anything you need![A]
[MidLeft]
Well[Beat] it's your life. If you wish to[N]
spend it for our cause, then I've no[N]
objections. What about you, Loewe?[A]
[Right]
Fine by me. Svetomir seems useful,[N]
and he already has the spirit.[N]
Just don't fall behind, got it?[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
I wouldn't dream of it![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Then I'll give you this staff.[N]
Put it to good use, Svetomir.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Of course. You can count on me![A][X]


## SennyFreedText
[MidRight][LoadSenny][ThreeLineBox]
You're freeing me? Oh, thank you so[N]
much! They threw me in here for taking[N]
part in Father Svetomir's protest.[AN]
He always does so much for us, watching[N]
over the children, but even still[Beat][N]
Why did I think that was a good idea?[AN]
Anyway, I'd better leave before the[N]
guards catch up. If we meet again,[N]
I'll thank you properly, alright?[AN]
Okay, I'd better get moving. Stay safe![A][X]

## HelmanFreedText
[MidRight][LoadHelman][ThreeLineBox]
Harumph! Never expected a bunch of[N]
youngsters to come to my aid. That[N]
damnable duke threw me in here,[AN]
all because I didn't pay my taxes.[N]
To that, I say phooey! A dog of the[N]
Cythean Empire deserves only scorn.[AN]
Oh, you agree? Well, if you ever find[N]
yourself in Vetheim, some of my family[N]
live there. Tell 'em Helman sent you,[AN]
and they may just help you out.[A][X]

S-Sir! The rebels are still pushing[N]
forward? What are your orders?[A]
[MidLeft]
That miscreant Boro was supposed to be[N]
keeping an eye on this situation...[AN]
We have to wait for him. [Red]Once he shows[N]
up, our victory is all but assured.[Red][A]
[MidRight]
Right! I'll fight with all[N]
I have until he does, sir![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
You go ahead and do that. Your[N]
sacrifice won't be forgotten, uh...[AN]
What was his name again? I forget.[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadRaschwitz]
I-Intruders, already?! Well,[N]
you'd best turn around now,[AN]
because you face the mighty[N]
Raschwitz, a true scourge![AN]
[Beat] You're still here?[N]
I-I see[Beat] Fine, then.[AN]
Perhaps my baleful arrows will[N]
strike some fear into you![A][X]

## RaschwitzDeathQuoteText
[MidLeft][LoadRaschwitz]
N-No[Beat] I wasn't supposed to die[N]
here. Duke Cidor, I'm sorry[Beat][A][X]

[MidRight][LoadCleo]
I don't hear any pursuers[Beat] It[N]
appears that we're safe, for now.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Not for long, I'd bet. Those dogs will[N]
follow any order from their master,[N]
no matter how long it takes them.[A]
[MidRight]
Indeed. Even for a vassal of Cythes,[N]
House Selise seems particularly[N]
devoted to maintaining the occupation.[A]
[MidLeft]
Can't say I'm surprised. Duke Cidor[N]
threw away his pride the moment he[N]
let the Cytheans in unchallenged.[AN]
All that's left for him now is[N]
licking General Argymos's boot.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Perhaps. I doubt he would[N]
want Cidor doing that, though.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Huh? What was that, Cleo?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Oh, nothing. We should start moving[N]
before our enemies continue their[N]
pursuit. General Dragana awaits us.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Right. Let's keep moving.[A][X]

## EndingSceneTextBoro
[MidRight][LoadBoro][ThreeLineBox]
Even knowing the odds, they still[N]
soldier on[Beat] Well, at least a few[N]
of the leftovers have some spine.[AN]
Still, why even bother when their[N]
chance of success is so low? Curious.[N]
I'll just follow them for now.[AN]
There's no need to rush bringing[N]
their heads back to that arrogant[N]
duke. He can wait a bit longer.[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadDragana]
Cidor[Beat] What do you want? I've[N]
no patience for traitorous swine.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Now, now. There is no need for harsh[N]
words, General Dragana. I simply came[N]
to inform you of your execution.[AN]
It will occur tomorrow, as planned.[A]
[MidRight]
Why not end me right here[N]
if you're that anxious?[N]
The waiting's killing me.[A]
[MidLeft]
I have no plans to do it personally.[N]
Besides, it must be public in order to[N]
properly crush your band's spirits.[A]
[MidRight]
Yet you felt the need to tell me[N]
yourself. I doubt you came here[N]
just to gloat about your victory.[AN]
Well, maybe you really wanted to hear[N]
stories about an old flame. Mira's[N]
doing quite well, no thanks to you.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]I'm glad that is the case.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Your daughter is best off of all,[N]
not knowing her father is a[N]
traitor to her own country.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You may see me as a traitor, but I will[N]
do what I must to protect my land and[N]
my people. Now, is there anything else?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Well, I have more, but if you tire[N]
of it, then just one question.[AN]
Didn't Boro's betrayal hinge on you[N]
not killing any of us unnecessarily?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
So he told you that much. Indeed,[N]
it did. I found it odd that a man[N]
throwing you all to the wolves cared,[AN]
but I humored his request. However,[N]
your death alone is necessary if[N]
the rebellion is to stay weak.[A]
[MidRight]
Is that so? I'd watch out if I were[N]
you. Angering Boro is likely to end[N]
with a spear in your back, Cidor.[A]
[MidLeft]
I will take my chances. The man has[N]
proven he valued money over your cause,[N]
and I cannot afford to let you recover.[AN]
With the Liberators finally defeated,[N]
your benefactors now lack their shield.[N]
I must capitalize on this good fortune.[A]
[MidRight]
Ha, good luck with that. You don't even[N]
know where House Freyse's nobility are,[N]
right? Besides, if you think we're done,[AN]
then you're not paying attention. Even[N]
if I fall here, they can continue on.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]My offer still stands, Dragana. If[N]
you tell me where the surviving heir is,[N]
I will allow you to keep your head.[A]
[MidRight]
No thanks. Even if I'm not their knight[N]
anymore, I still have the pride of one.[N]
You're not getting anything from me.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Very well, you've made yourself clear.[N]
Spend your final hours wisely, general.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[Event]
[MidRight][LoadDragana][ThreeLineBox]
Heh[Beat] Since they went on the run, I[N]
haven't heard anything from them.[N]
Couldn't tell him even if I wanted to.[AN]
I wonder how everyone else is doing.[N]
At the very least, Mira should be safe,[N]
and some of us escaped their ambush.[AN]
[Beat]I hope Loewe and Cleo are alright,[N]
at least. If they keep living, then[N]
I'm certain that we still have hope.[A][X]
