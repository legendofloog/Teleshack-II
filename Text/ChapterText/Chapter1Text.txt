Of course, they could never last.[AN]
Not when the Cytheans hungered[N]

Loewe! Are you done playing?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Yeah, all my friends went home.[N]
I won again, as usual, heh.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You know the forest well by now, I see.[N]
No doubt the fruits of your training.[N]
Speaking of[Beat] are you ready?[A]
[MidRight]
Ugh, do I have to, Mom? It's not like[N]
I need to know how to use a sword[N]
when we're living in a town like this.[A]
[MidLeft]
You never know when that may change.[N]
We may be safe here in Decia, but[Beat][N]
who knows how long that'll last?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Why? Are the Cytheans gonna attack?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Perhaps. They've busied themselves[N]
with Mahemen recently, but they could[N]
turn their gaze east at any moment.[AN]
Your father and I barely escaped them[N]
the first time with you in our arms[Beat][N]
You cannot take them lightly, Loewe.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]So I have to learn to defend[N]
myself just in case? If you say so,[N]
Mom, then I'll train a whole lot![A]
[MidLeft]
Good. Our time is limited, and you have[N]
a long way to go before being able to[N]
survive against them on your own.[A]
[MidRight]
Hm? You and Dad are here,[N]
so I don't have to, right?[N]
You're not going away?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Of course not.[A] Now, that's enough[N]
talking! We should begin your training[N]
for the day before the sun falls.[AN]
If you do well, your father said[N]
that he'd make your favorite treat.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]

You're lucky you were in the forest,[N]
or you too would have met the Cytheans.[N]
Why were you away from Linoras, lad?[A]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
My mom and dad told me to run[Beat][N]
and I[Beat] I just left them.[N]
And now[Beat] We're separated[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
You're alive, and that's what matters.[N]
Had you stayed, you would have only[N]
died along with the other villagers.[A]
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
You don't know that they're dead![N]
My mom's real tough, so my parents[Beat][N]
They're still alive. They have to be.[A]
[MidLeft]
...I understand your sorrow, but even[N]
after seeing your home in ashes,[N]
you still believe they're safe?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] [Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Well, let's put that aside for now.[N]
Do you have any relatives that[N]
can take you in until you find them?[A]
[MidRight]
No, I don't. We all fled here[N]
from Mahemen, so any family[N]
left is across the Decian Sea.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I see[Beat] In that case, why not[N]
come with me? I can offer you food[N]
and shelter, at the very least.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]First, who are you people?[N]
I've never seen you around town.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
We are the Decian Liberators, those[N]
brave enough to resist the impending[N]
Cythean occupation of our homeland.[AN]
I am their leader, Dragana Kasun.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Can you teach me how to fight,[N]
then? How to become one of you?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I could show you how to use a bow, but[Beat][N]
It would be many years before I even[N]
consider letting you on a battlefield.[A]
[MidRight]
Yeah, I figured[Beat] I know I'm weak.[N]
Still, when I think about what[N]
happened to my home and friends[Beat][AN]
When I think of those people[N]
getting away with this, I can't[N]
just sit around and watch it happen.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I'll consider it, but for now,[N]
we should leave and head to our base.[AN]
Ah, right. What's your name, boy?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
It's Loewe[Beat] Hold on, Miss Kasun.[N]

Why is it still here?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That's a question you can ask later.[N]
Is it too heavy for you to carry?[N]
I can hold on to it for you.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
No, I'll keep it with me.[N]
It's my[Beat] responsibility, now.[A]

Come on, there's no need to be[N]
so cold. We're cell buddies![A]

Buddy isn't a word I'd use to[N]
describe a pestering priest.[AN]
If you don't need anything,[N]
then leave me alone, got it?[A]

Someone woke up on the wrong side[N]

in thought, so you must not have heard.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]

Down the hall, it sounded like weapons[N]
were clashing. Maybe some rescuers are[N]
coming to free us? I hope so, anyway.[A]
[MidRight]
Can't imagine any other reason someone[N]
would break into these musty dungeons,[N]
which means she got my message after all.[A]

We've finally made it. Even with Loewe's[N]
information, Duke Cidor's manse has[N]
more powerful defenses than I expected.[AN]
[Left]
The fool got himself captured for it[Beat][N]
Well, at least his dragon made it back.[AN]
Thanks to that luck, we may still have[N]
a chance at rescuing Kasun. Iskra,[N]
Emil, are you sure you're ready?[AN]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Ready as I'll ever be, Mom. You need[N]
everyone you can get, right? Plus,[AN]
I've gotta give Loewe a piece of my[N]
mind for saddling me with this sword.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Even if our odds are low, we have to[N]
try. Without General Dragana, we never[N]
would have made it this far, right?[AN]
I'm not sure how she got outmaneuvered,[N]
but we gotta do all we can to help her![A]
[Left]
Indeed. First though, we should[N]
break Loewe out of his cell. We'll need[N]
every capable fighter we can get.[AN]
After that, we'll have to go deeper[N]
into the dungeons to find Kasun.[A]
[Right]
Mm[Beat] with stealth off the table,[N]
every guard here will come for our heads.[N]
We must move with haste to succeed.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Then let us go. Cleo, I expect you to[N]
call the shots from here on out.[AN]
Kasun entrusted you with strategic[N]
counsel in the main unit, did she not?[A]
[Right]
Yes, Captain Mira. Loewe and[N]
I served as her adjutants.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Consider the recon unit at your[N]
disposal, then. I trust that[N]
you two have no problem with this?[A]
[FarLeft]
None at all. Just use us well,[N]
Cleo. We've lost too many of[N]
our allies to falter here.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Right. All of our hopes are riding on[N]
this mission, so there's no going back.[A]

Do you hear that, Alena? Looks like[N]
the fighting's gotten underway.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Seems so. Well, you know the score.[N]
The duke's paying us well for this[N]
job, so we'll have to earn our keep.[AN]
Let's wait just a bit longer to make[N]
our move. With any luck, the regular[N]
guards'll soften the rebels up for us.[A]
[Right]
You got it, boss. A day's work in[N]
gold is waiting for us! Let's get[N]
this over with and hit the tavern.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

Like I give a damn about that[Beat][Red] Once[N]
I find Svet, we'll break out of here[N]

down after that[Beat] what a nuisance.[A][X]

I'll have to hasten our escape plans.[A][X]

## BoroSpawnText

There's still a fight going on?[N]
Looks like the Liberators didn't[N]
send their best to save Dragana.[AN]
Only fools would keep fighting for[N]
a cause as sorry and lost as this,[N]
instead of accumulating gold instead.[AN]
Well, I'm not one of them anymore,[N]
so I don't need to hold back.[N]
Can't say I want to kill old comrades,[AN]
but if any of them meet my spear, then[N]
they can only blame their misfortune![A][X]

[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
Iskra, I'm glad you're safe.[N]
Do you still have my sword?[A]

Of course I do. You entrusted it to[N]
me, so there's no way I'd lose it.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Thanks. I knew I could count on you.[A][ToggleSmile]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I don't want your gratitude, Loewe.[N]
Just don't make another plan risky[N]
enough where you'd need to do this.[AN]
[MidRight]
Sorry, but I can't promise anything.[N]
I'll do what I must to free Dragana,[N]
even if it means risking everything.[AN]
It's thanks to her that I'm here,[N]
so I can't let Cidor do this to her![A]
[MidLeft]
We all want to save the general,[N]
but we need all the leadership we[N]
can get our hands on in her absence.[AN]
That includes you, as her adjutant.[N]
Tell me that you won't die like a fool,[N]
or I'm not giving the sword back.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]You know how to twist my arm.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Of course. I've learned[N]
that much over the years.[A][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]
Fine, I won't take any unnecessary[N]
risks. Is that good enough for you?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I suppose it'll do. Here, take it.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Finally! Feels good to have[N]
his back in my hands. Now, let's-[A]
[MidLeft]
Hold on. If you don't mind me asking[Beat][N]
Can you teach me how to use a sword?[AN]
I want to be able to defend myself.[N]
even if I'm unable to use my magic.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You sure you should ask me? What little[N]
I know comes from my mother, but she[N]
died before I learned much of anything.[AN]
Looking back now, her swordmanship was[N]
peerless. A pride of Mahemen, no doubt.[A]
[MidLeft]
I've seen you practicing on[N]
your own sometimes, though.[N]
You look pretty good to me.[A]
[MidRight]
Maybe to an amateur, but a real[N]
Mahemeni swordmaster's movements[N]
blur together at ridiculous speed.[AN]
I'm but an infant in comparison.[A]
[MidLeft]
Mahemen[Beat] I heard that their rebels[N]
are in a much better position than us.[AN]
Maybe if we teamed up with them, our[N]
forces could send the Cytheans packing.[A]
[MidRight]
Perhaps[Beat] Or a swordmaster there[N]
could help finish my training. Right[N]
now, my sword is of use to no one.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Hm[Beat] What's holding you back[N]
from using a sword in the field?[A]
[MidRight]
When I'm facing a real person with one,[N]
there's a[Beat] sense of hesitation.[AN]
I can barely ignore it in spars, let[N]
alone a real battle. Still, if you want[N]
to learn, then I can show you a bit.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Ha, I'm glad to hear it. Wouldn't[N]
want to twist your other arm too.[A][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]
Yeah, yeah, get moving. We've[N]
wasted enough time talking, Iskra.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

Coarse as ever[Beat] I hope he's a[N]
bit nicer as a teacher, at least.[A][X]



## EmilCleoTalkCh1Text

[MidRight][LoadEmil]
Oh, uh, hey there, Cleo![N]
I just had a question for you.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Very well. Emil, was it? Ask[N]
away, but please make it quick.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Well, is it true that you're[N]
from the Cythean Empire?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
That I am[Beat] Why do you ask?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Oh, because I am too![N]
Not often you see another[N]
who abandoned Cythes, eh?[A]
[MidLeft]
Not often at all. I never expected[N]
to meet another deserter here.[N]
Where do you hail from, Emil?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Just a small village close to the[N]
border of Decia. What about you?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I was born in Gechrysos.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
The capital? Wow, you[N]
must've been rich.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I cannot deny it. My family used our[N]
wealth to give me a stellar education[N]
at a military academy in the city.[AN]
They meant to raise me as the perfect,[N]
honorable officer of the Cythean Empire,[N]
just as my elder brother was before me.[AN]
Of course, that didn't turn out well.[A]
[MidRight]
The way you talk, sounds like the[N]
army was a way of life for you.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
...Because it was. My family has[N]
long served the imperial line,[N]
and I expected to do the same.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hmm... Y'know, a guy cut from the same[N]
cloth inspired me to sign up for Cythes.[AN]
Maybe you've heard of him? His name[N]
is Elias Argymos, and he leads the[N]
occupation of Decia as its general.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Of course I've heard of him.[N]
How did you meet El-[.4] the general?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
One day, he came into my town looking[N]
for recruits. Tell you what, I've never[N]
seen a finer knight in my time here.[AN]
The model Cythean soldier, fighting for[N]
his country[Beat] With a man like that[N]
leading the occupation, it seemed just.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]And then you came here and saw the[N]
truth for your own eyes, as I did.[N]
That we were lied to, about everything.[A]
[MidRight]
Yeah[Beat] I'd only trained for a few[N]
weeks before defecting from my squad.[N]
What we were doing[Beat] It wasn't right.[AN]
They chased me down, but thankfully,[N]
Mira and the recon unit saved me.[N]
How did you end up on this side?[A]
[MidLeft]
I received a commissioned position[N]
based off of my family name, and[N]
for a time, I followed my orders.[AN]
The guilt became too much to bear.[AN]
When I came across General Dragana,[N]
I surrendered immediately to her,[N]
expecting I'd soon meet my death.[AN]
Instead, she let me live. I mean to[N]
repay that mercy in any way that I can.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
That's all we can do now[Beat] Sorry, that[N]
ended up taking longer than I thought.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Yes, we should focus on the mission.[N]
However, it was helpful, discussing[N]
this with someone else who understands.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Agreed. Well, I'll go on ahead, Cleo.[N]
Maybe we can talk some other time![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Argymos[Beat] So Emil met my brother?[N]
If I continue on this path, then[N]
I may have to see him again soon[Beat][A][X]

So[Beat] it's finally come to this[Beat][N]
Fine then, have at you, knave![A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Let me finish! I'm here to break you[N]
out, moron. Besides, how do you plan[N]
to fight me with just that staff?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I have my ways[Beat] Well, that's good.[N]
You wouldn't want to cross a holy man.[A]
[MidLeft]
Sure[Beat] Let's just get out of here[N]
while the rebels distract the guards.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Sorry, but I can't do that. Turns out[N]
their general is locked up in here,[N]
and they need someone to heal them.[AN]
I finally have the chance to help free[N]
Decia, and I won't let it pass by.[A]
[MidLeft]
Come on, use your head. We lost years[N]
ago when Duke Cidor waved the white[N]
flag and welcomed the Cythean Empire.[AN]
Joining up with the half-dead scraps[N]
of the Liberators is a death sentence![A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Can you say that you're satisfied[N]
running away for the rest of your life?[N]
The duke'll give you a bounty for this.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Of course not. I don't enjoy seeing[N]
them in charge anymore than you.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Then join us! If any part of you wants[N]
to see this land freed from its chains,[N]
then please heed my words, Alena.[AN]
We may be down, but there are still[N]
cards left to play. Don't give up hope[N]
for the return of the Decia we knew![A]
[MidLeft]
You've resorted to begging? Well, you[N]
must really be serious[Beat] Alright,[N]
I get it. Even if this is stupid,[AN]
even if it means we're just going to[N]
die, to hell with it. I'm with you.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I knew you'd see things my way![N]
Well then, milady, after you.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Still hiding behind me, eh Svet?[N]
I guess some things don't change[Beat][N]
Fine then. I'll carve a path for you![A][X]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Your wyvern? Some members of the recon[N]

I brought you a bow. Ready to fight?[A]
[Right]
I always am. Did you find out where[N]
they're keeping Dragana? The guards[N]
wouldn't say a word about it, of course.[A]
[MidLeft]
From the few we've interrogated, she's[N]
deeper in the dungeons. I couldn't[N]
find her exact location, however.[A]
[Right]
Then we have to get a move on, quickly.[N]
If it comes to it, we may need to leave[N]
behind some of our allies, as well.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
What are you saying? How are we[N]
supposed to continue on without them?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
It would be difficult, but if we have[N]
no other choice, then [Red]at least the two[N]
of us have to live to see another day.[Red][AN]
Rescuing Dragana is our top priority,[N]
and we can't afford to fail, Cleo.[A]
[MidLeft]
It won't come to that.[Red] I'll make sure[N]
everyone else escapes before us.[Red][N]
That way, no one will be captured.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
I hope it does go that easily. Still,[N]
we have to be prepared for anything.[A]
[FarRight][LoadSvetomir]
Uh, hello there. Sorry to butt in, but[N]
are you two members of the Liberators?[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
That we are. And who are you?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'm Svetomir, a priest of Vetheim, a[N]
town at the foot of the duke's manse.[N]
I organized a protest against him,[AN]
but he threw me and my fellows in[N]

You have my thanks for freeing me.[A]

Well, you're safe now. You should[N]
leave while you still can, priest.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Wait! I'm quite the healer, you know.[N]
If you let me join you and give me[N]
a staff, I can mend your wounds.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
You mean to become one of us?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
I've spent my days hoping Byelen would[N]
hear my prayers[Beat] That he would strike[N]
down the invaders and save our country.[AN]
However, I now understand his answer.[AN]
I must take matters into my own hands.[N]
If it'll help you chase out the Cytheans,[AN]
then I'll do anything you need![A]
[MidLeft]
Well[Beat] it's your life. If you wish to[N]
spend it for our cause, then I've no[N]
objections. What about you, Loewe?[A]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
Fine by me. Svetomir seems useful,[N]
and he already has the spirit.[N]
Just don't fall behind, got it?[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
I wouldn't dream of it![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Then I'll give you this staff.[N]
Put it to good use, Svetomir.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Of course. You can count on me![A][X]


## SennyFreedText
[MidRight][LoadSenny][ThreeLineBox]
You're freeing me? Oh, thank you so[N]
much! They threw me in here for taking[N]
part in Father Svetomir's protest.[AN]
He always does so much for us, watching[N]
over the children, but even still[Beat][N]
Why did I think that was a good idea?[AN]
Anyway, I'd better leave before the[N]
guards catch up. If we meet again,[N]
I'll thank you properly, alright?[AN]
Okay, I'd better get moving. Stay safe![A][X]

## HelmanFreedText
[MidRight][LoadHelman][ThreeLineBox]
Harumph! Never expected a bunch of[N]
youngsters to come to my aid. That[N]
damnable duke threw me in here,[AN]
all because I didn't pay my taxes.[N]
To that, I say phooey! A dog of the[N]
Cythean Empire deserves only scorn.[AN]
Oh, you agree? Well, if you ever find[N]
yourself in Vetheim, some of my family[N]
live there. Tell 'em Helman sent you,[AN]
and they may just help you out.[A][X]

You've got bigger things[N]

Do you remember what you[N]

C-Come now, no need to be[N]

Plans change. Besides, I only[N]
took the job to save a friend.[AN]
I've got no allegiance to you.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

Y-You reprobate! This is why[N]
you can't trust a sellsword![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

That miscreant Boro was supposed to be[N]
keeping an eye on this situation[Beat][AN]
We have to wait for him. [Red]Once he shows[N]
up, our victory is all but assured.[Red][A]
[MidRight]
Right! I'll fight with all[N]
I have until he does, sir![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

You go ahead and do that. Your[N]

strike some fear into you![A][X]

Even knowing the odds, they still[N]
soldier on[Beat] Well, at least a few[N]
of the leftovers have some spine.[AN]
Still, why even bother when their[N]
chance of success is so low? Hm[Beat][N]
I'll just follow them for now.[AN]
There's no need to rush bringing[N]
their heads back to that arrogant[N]
duke. He can wait a bit longer[Beat][A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadCidor]
[MidRight][LoadDragana]
Cidor[Beat] What do you want? I've[N]
no patience for traitorous swine.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Now, now. There is no need for harsh[N]
words, General Dragana. I simply came[N]
to inform you of your execution.[AN]
It will occur tomorrow, as planned.[A]
[MidRight]
Why not end me right here[N]
if you're that anxious?[N]
The waiting's killing me.[A]
[MidLeft]
I have no plans to do it personally.[N]
Besides, it must be public in order to[N]
properly crush your band's spirits.[A]
[MidRight]
Yet you felt the need to tell me[N]
yourself. I doubt you came here[N]
just to gloat about your victory.[AN]
Oh, maybe you really wanted to hear[N]
stories about an old flame. Mira's[N]
doing quite well, no thanks to you.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]I'm glad that is the case.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Your daughter is best off of all,[N]
not knowing her father is a[N]
traitor to her own country.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I do what I must to protect my[N]
land and my people. Now, do you[N]
have any other clever remarks?[AN]
[MidRight]
Just a few more, but if you tire[N]
of them, then I'll just ask this.[AN]
Boro told me that his departure[N]
hinged on you not killing any of[N]
the Liberators unnecessarily.[AN]
Do you plan on breaking your oath?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]My [OpenQuote]oath" remains true. You, alone,[N]
must die to ensure the Liberators stay[N]
down. I may have humored Boro's request,[AN]
odd as it may be, but there are limits[N]
to my grace. I trust he understands.[A]
[MidRight]
I'd watch out if I were you, Cidor.[N]
If he does take issue with your actions,[N]
you'll soon feel a spear in your back.[AN]
Boro's not the type to go along[N]
with orders he doesn't like.[A]
[MidLeft]
I'll take my chances. The man has[N]
proven he valued money over your cause,[N]
and I cannot afford to let you recover.[AN]
With the Liberators finally defeated,[N]
your benefactors now lack their shield.[N]
I must capitalize on this good fortune.[A]
[MidRight]
Ha, good luck with that. You don't even[N]
know where House Freyse's nobility are.[N]
so how do you plan to capture them?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]My offer still stands, Dragana. If[N]
you tell me where the surviving heir is,[N]
I will allow you to keep your head.[A]
[MidRight]
No thanks. Even if I'm not their knight[N]
anymore, I still have the pride of one.[N]
You're not getting anything from me.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]If that is your choice, then so be it.[N]
Let it not be said that I lack mercy.[N]
Spend your final hours wisely, general.[A][X]

Heh[Beat] Since they went on the run, I[N]
haven't heard anything from them.[N]
Couldn't tell him even if I wanted to.[AN]
I wonder how everyone else is doing.[N]
At the very least, Mira should be safe,[N]
and some of us escaped their ambush.[AN]
[Beat]I hope Loewe and Cleo are alright.[N]
If they live on and fight, then freedom[N]
for all Decians may still be in reach[Beat][A][X]

Not for long, I'd bet. Those dogs will[N]

no matter how long it takes them.[A]
[MidRight]
Indeed. Even for a vassal of Cythes,[N]
House Selese seems particularly[N]
devoted to maintaining the occupation.[A]
[MidLeft]
Can't say I'm surprised. Duke Cidor[N]
threw away his pride the moment he[N]
let the Cytheans in unchallenged.[AN]
All that's left for him now is[N]
licking General Argymos's boot.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Perhaps. I doubt he would[N]
want Cidor doing that, though.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Huh? What was that, Cleo?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Oh, nothing. We should start moving[N]

She knew the risks, Loewe.[N]
We just have to keep moving,[N]
so that her sacrifice isn't wasted.[AN]
[Beat]She gave me this before her[N]
death. Your sword, I take it?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Yes. I left it to her before going[N]

Cidor will pay for this treachery![AN]
Even General Argymos himself won't[N]
