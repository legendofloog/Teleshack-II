# recap situation + omg bad guys are soldiers of taraji in chouwouj wtf

[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadKwame][OpenRight][LoadCleo][OpenFarRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[OpenRight]
Now that we've obtained the sword,[N]
all that remains is hunting down Taraji.[AN]
Let's review our situation: Taraji is[N]
residing somewhere here in Chouwouj.[AN]
The humid jungles aren't ideal,[N]
but it's the only shot we got.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
Mmm, and I'm betting my mother[N]
won't be far from him, either.[AN]
We can suss out both of them[N]
at once.[AN]
This is one of the few chances[N]
we'll be able to get[Beat][AN]

[OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft]
Loewe. Cloe. The scouts have returned. We[N]
have located her wherabouts.[AN]
Yet strange power- unknown even to[N]
me, lies there also.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
A warlord of Chouwouj[Beat] Can we[N]
really defeat Taraji?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
There is no time for hesitation. You knew this[N]
path would not be a secure one.[AN]
Our choices lead us to this[N]
scarred road.[AN]
The Pitviper will not be so easily[N]
convinced or defeated.[AN]
Ages past, her deft twin blades deflected[N]
my arcane spells with ease.[AN]
Swift. Resistant. Taraji's duel swords[N]
are not to be trifled with.[AN]
Your simple blades and arrows would[N]
not stand a chance.[AN]

[OpenRight]
We've defeated members of[N]
the Immortals before.[AN]
I know Taraji will be a fierce[N]
enemy, but[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Yet none of us rival the[N]
power of the Pitviper.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
We have to try. We've gone[N]
so far in this journey.[AN]
What else was our choices and[N]
battles for[Beat]?[AN][X]

## Ch20Opening2
# move onto map, see tons of taraji soldiers
# DON'T WRITE AMONG US WRITE WITH US DON'T WRITE AMONG US WRITE WITH US
[OpenFarLeft][LoadCleo][OpenLeft][LoadLoewePunished][OpenFarFarRight][LoadKwame]

[OpenLeft]
Are those soldiers[Beat][N]
hostile?[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
We do not yet know[Beat] More importantly,[N]
where and who is their leader?[AN]

[OpenLeft]
What would Dragana do in[N]
this situation[Beat][AN]

[OpenFarFarRight][MoveMidRight]
[OpenMidRight]
Loewe. You have to make your[N]
own choices now.[AN]
Dragana Kasun is no longer[N]
with us.[AN]
I know the pain keeps you numb,[N]
Loewe. But you cannot forget.[AN]
What we do here, what you want here[Beat][N]
What you must do for the liberation.[AN]

[OpenLeft]
I don't know what to do[N]
here, Kwame.[AN]
They don't look like Cytheans,[N]
or just ordinary brigands.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
I recognize the emblem on[N]
their armor.[AN]
They[Beat] must be affiliated[N]
with the Pitviper herself.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
Then[Beat] Then Taraji must be nearby.[N]
Ready our forces, Loewe![AN]

[OpenLeft]
I[Beat] I understand. If we can[N]
win this battle,[AN]
then the Pitviper is within[N]
our reach.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
We must test our mettle against[N]
her forces first.[AN]
They are not Cytheans- our enemies, just[N]
those who need to die for our cause.[AN]
Are you two ready or not, commanders[N]
of the Decian Liberation?[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
I'm ready. If we go down, we better[N]
go down swinging![AN]

[OpenLeft]
[Beat]We're all ready.[N]
Come at us![AN]
[X]

## Ch20Ending1
# bgm change to knight's vow?
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKwame][OpenRight][LoadLoewePunished][OpenFarRight][LoadCleo]

[OpenMidLeft]
That was[Beat] fierce. This is another[N]
victory for the liberation.[AN]

[OpenFarRight]
It's hard to believe- were these really[N]
soldiers of Taraji?[AN]

[OpenRight]
All this[Beat] carnage. How[Beat] what did[N]
we do here?[AN]
How did we slay all of[N]
them so[Beat] quicky?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
You said it yourself; we must continue[N]
searching for Taraji.[AN]
Our path here is set through the[N]
sealed fates of the slain.[AN]
We cannot afford to miss[N]
another opportunity.[AN]
Unless the 'Seed of Byelen' wants to[N]
admit defeat here and now?[AN]

[OpenRight]
No, I understand now. Through each[N]
sacrifice, everything is within reach.[AN]
Their voices echo along with[N]
her faint voice[Beat][AN]
It's another voice in the cacophony,[N]
lead by Dragana[Beat][AN]

[OpenFarRight]
Loewe[Beat] I understand your sorrows, but[N]
we must keep our focus on the liberation.[AN]

[OpenRight]
I[Beat] I know. I thought I could[N]
overcome my- our struggles[Beat][AN]
I[Beat] I need a moment. My mother, Dragana.[N]
All these voices[Beat] Just, go find Taraji.[AN][ClearFace]

[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight]

[OpenMidRight]
Kwame, I[Beat] These weren't Cytheans[N]
or anything we've fought thus far.[AN]
These were a warlord's very[N]
own soldiers![AN]
Our strength is honestly greater than I[N]
could've ever imagined we could reach.[AN]
Yet[Beat] the amount of power we[N]
have[Beat] it's harrowing.[AN]
Even Cidor seemed like a small stepping[N]
stone for our conquest.[AN][Event]

[OpenMidLeft]
Cleo. Who will you be inscribed as in[N]
the pages of Orodreth's history?[AN]
Will they call you a ruthless fighter,[N]
with your hands stained in blood?[AN]
Or the savior that we all see, who will[N]
achieve any feat to liberate this continent?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
[Beat]They'll see a savior, a light of[N]
Orodreth when the ages are dire.[AN]
We can do anything; we've defeated[N]
immortals, men allied with the warlords.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
My goal- our goal is within reach,[N]
is that not true?[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Everything we've done was always[N]
for the Liberation.[AN]
Yet with all of this power[Beat] What more[N]
can a simple soldier achieve[Beat]?[AN]
Alright, Kwame. Let's regroup and[N]
hunt down Taraji at once.[AN]

New champions, a seed of the world[Beat][N][CloseEyes]
Liberators of Orodreth[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]
It's all too much. So much rests[N]
on my shoulders[Beat][AN]
Yet who can I turn to, here?[N]
Cleo? No. Kwame? Hmm[Beat][AN]
Even when this is all over, how can[N]
I unite everyone under our banner?[AN][Event]

[OpenFarFarLeft]
You there. Seed of Byelen. I admit the[N]
Liberator's strength is[Beat] unexpected.[AN]

[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadLoewe]
[Beat]Show yourself.[AN]

[OpenFarLeft]
So. I take it you are the ones[N]
who are looking for me[Beat][AN]

## Ch20MidBattle
# introduce units as enemy recruits? they move onto map and then show this text
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJerry][OpenMidRight][LoadLyre]

[OpenMidRight]
Do you see that, Jerry? Are those really[Beat][N]
the real Decian Liberators?[AN]
[MoveMidRight]Word of their grand exploits have[N]
really spread like wildfire![AN]
[MoveMidRight]Their exploits are incredible[Beat][N]
[MoveMidRight]Cleo and Loewe, in the flesh!![AN]
[MoveMidRight][ToggleSmile]I can't believe that's really them[Beat][N]
I'm starstruck, I want to meet them![AN][ToggleSmile]

[OpenMidLeft]
Gah, Lyre. Get a damned hold of[N]
yourself. Look at our situation![AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Wait,[.4] Jerry[Beat] You're actually[N]
sober for once? What's the occasion?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]Hahahahahahaha[N][MoveMidLeft]

[CloseEyes][MoveMidLeft]*cough* [MoveMidLeft]*cough* [OpenEyes]Ergh, who do ya think[N]
I am? You wound me, Lyre- I don't drink[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Uh-huh. A reminder that you got us[N]
kicked out of the bar last night.[AN]
[Beat]And also the fight at the inn. Can't[N]
forget the gambling business either.[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Well, that's just life, eh? We can't[N]
just go back and face Taraji[Beat][AN]

[OpenMidRight]
[MoveMidRight]And who's fault is that? Your blood[N]
rushes keep getting us into trouble![AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
Ah, come on. We're all in this[N]
together. I can't help it![AN]
After Taraji got into that fancy[N]
occult-blood-sword-stuff business,[AN]
a lot of her henchmen are[N]
like us: out of work![AN]

[OpenMidRight]
Maybe[Beat] Say, you think we can join up[N]
with the Decian Liberators?[AN]

[OpenMidLeft]
We're always livin' life[N]
on the edge, eh?[AN]
I'd say if we don't get beheaded[N]
first, then sure! Why not?[AN]

We're enemies, then. Brace yourself.[AN]

[OpenMidRight]
