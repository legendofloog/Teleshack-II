[MidRight][LoadTaraji]
[MidLeft][LoadLoewePunished]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]
You're[Beat] Taraji![A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]
Yes, yes.[A][N]
You're very clever indeed to[N]
figure that out, you know that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm ready to take you on, Pitviper.[N]
The Kaiserschwert awaits you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Such bravado, child! No,[N]
no, I mean to talk first.[A][N]
Why do you follow Athanasius?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]
You mean Kwame?[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]
A little bird told me of what[N]
that wily old dog's scheming now.[A][N]
His scheme wants to kill you,[N]
and himself along with it.[A][N]
What madness.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You mortals confuse me, and[N]
somehow, Athanasius most of all.[A][N]
Why would someone with wisdom[N]
and power like his ever hunger[N]
for a knife through his heart?[A][N]
All of Orodreth's glory[N]
was in reach for him,[A][N]
and he wastes it chanting[N]
forgotten spells in dark corners?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
And you use your immortality[N]
to conquer and slaughter?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]
What else is there to do with it?[N]
That's the only right path.[A][N]
You could join me upon[N]
it, Seed of Byelen.[A][N]
You've mighty blood and[N]
blessing within you, and[N]
swordsmanship yet mightier.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Well?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]It[Beat][A][N]
Maybe Kwame's not quite trustworthy,[N]
and maybe I don't want to die.[A][N]
But you're still a murderous monster[N]
who's ended countless innocent lives.[A][N]
I don't have remorse for[N]
destroying the likes of you![A]
[OpenMidRight]
You think I fear that sword?[N]
It's but a toothpick before me.[A][N]
En garde, Seed of Byelen.[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadTaraji]
[MidLeft][LoadLoewePunished]
[OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes]
Gaah![N]
So[Beat] strong[Beat]![A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
This is the legendary hero of the[N]
Decian Liberators? This is the[N]
One-Eyed Dragon of Mahemen?[A][N]
No, I'll tell you what you are.[A][N]
You are nothing. You are[N]
mortal, Seed of Byelen.[N]
[ToggleSmile]And I am the Pitviper![A][X]

// catrin shows up epically

## Chapter21Intro_3
[MidRight][LoadTaraji]
[FarLeft][LoadLoewePunished]
[Left][LoadGrimblade]
[OpenLeft][OneLineBox]
There's no need to worry.[A]
[FarLeft]
Mom[Beat]![A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Looks like we finally[N]
meet face to face, Taraji.[A]
[MidRight]
Hm? Am I supposed[N]
to recognize you?[A]
[Left]
Lord Dikembe, who you slew,[N]
was a[Beat] dear friend of mine.[A][N]
I shall see him avenged.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Mom, you can't win-[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
I've[Beat] grown stronger since[N]
we last met in Mahemen, Loewe.[A][N]
Leave the Pitviper's forces to me.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[Left]
Damn it, Loewe, run![A][X]

// loewe leaves

## Chapter21Intro_4
[MidRight][LoadTaraji]
[MidLeft][LoadGrimblade]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
And there goes the Seed of Byelen.[A][N]
Looks like it's just you, me, and[N]
my army of hundreds of warriors.[A][N]
Do you really think you can win?[A]
[MidLeft]
Maybe. Maybe not. Let's[N]
find out together, shall we?[A][N]
Your soldiers die first.[A][X]

// catrin epically kills some generics

## Chapter21Intro_5
[MidRight][LoadTaraji]
[MidLeft][LoadGrimblade]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
You've done a fine job cutting[N]
down my troops, oh dear Grimblade.[A][N]
But even with that[N]
mighty new sword of yours,[A][N]
you're far, far too tired[N]
to stand a chance against me.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Well?[A][N]
Don't you want to come closer[N]
and avenge your Lord Dikembe?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]ngh[Beat][A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Then allow me.[A][N]
You've made this annoying, so[N]
I'll savor this, you little-[A][X]

## Chapter21Intro_6
[MidRight][LoadTaraji]
[Left][LoadGrimblade]
[FarLeft][LoadCleo]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Lady Catrin! I'll take you[N]
to safety. Get on my pegasus![A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Didn't need to tell me twice.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
How cowardly of you,[N]
o mighty Grimblade.[A][X]

## Chapter21Intro_WarCamp
[FarLeft][LoadBoroScarred]
[Left][LoadCleo]
[Right][LoadLoewePunished]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[Left]
[Beat]and so Catrin ran off[N]
once we got to safety.[A]
[FarLeft]
It looked to me like she[N]
was looking for someone.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]It's good to hear that[N]
my mother is safe, at least.[A][N]
So, what now?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
I saw Taraji's army back there.[A][N]
Even with the swath Catrin[N]
cut through it, we don't have[N]
the raw numbers to take her on.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
If I may interject, I have an idea[N]
for gaining the numbers we need.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Oh?[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
You know of the way Chouwouj is[N]
ruled by feuding warlords, yes?[A][N]
Dozens of leaders commanding small[N]
armies and stretches of territory,[A][N]
constantly clashing over[N]
scraps of land and resources.[A]
[Left]
And the infamous Pitviper is[N]
the strongest of them all.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Yes, but not the only one.[A][N]
Even now, her conquest's grip[N]
only covers about two thirds[N]
of Chouwouj's landmass.[A][N]
There are places in the inland[N]
mountains and coastal isles where[N]
lesser warlords still resist her,[A][N]
in addition to clashing[N]
amongst themselves.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Then are you suggesting[N]
we get their help?[A]
[FarRight]
How astute![A][N]
The Liberators' camp here is[N]
near the Himbasha Mountains.[A][N]
Up there, I know of at least four[N]
warlords who could join our ranks.[A][N]
If we won most or all[N]
of them to our side,[A][N]
we would have a force comparable[N]
in strength to the Pitviper's.[A]
[FarLeft]
And you're sure that these[N]
warlords are trustworthy?[A]
[Right]
Most of them probably hate[N]
Taraji just as much as we do.[A][N]
And even if we can't trust[N]
the warlords long-term,[A][N]
we only need to work together long[N]
enough to take the Pitviper down.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
On that note, Taraji currently[N]
resides in a fortress nestled[N]
within those same mountains.[A][N]
It once belonged to the late[N]
Lord Dikembe, but she claimed it[N]
for her own when she slew him.[A][N]
Dikembe's daughter is among the[N]
warlords still challenging her now.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
If you were close to Dikembe,[N]
that means she'll likely help us.[A][N]
It seems we have the[N]
makings of a plan.[A]
[Right]
Let's set off, then.[A][N]
Into the Himbasha Mountains, and[N]
towards the last Immortal's end.[A][X]

## Chapter21Intro_BoroDepressed
[MidLeft][LoadBoroScarred]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Boro? You wanted to talk?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Yeah.[A]
[MidRight]
What is it?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat] [CloseEyes]feel like I'm[N]
losing my purpose.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
What do you mean?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Back with the Liberators,[A][N]
I was fighting to save Decia[N]
or some nonsense like that.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
With Cidor, and then the Grimblade,[N]
I was fighting for the sake of gold.[A][N]
But now, we're killing ancient immortals[N]
to save the world from calamity?[A][N]
I'm a strong man, but still[N]
just a man. I've lost track[N]
of what's going on, and why.[A][N]
I've lost track of what role[N]
I was ever meant to play.[A][N]
What do I even do here?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Trajan and the rest of the[N]
Liberators still don't quite[N]
trust me, and rightfully so.[A][N]
[Beat]What do I do, Cleo?[A]
[MidRight]
You get a damn hold of[N]
yourself, that's what.[A][N]
No matter who you're fighting,[N]
this war won't stop.[N]
The Liberators won't stop.[A][N]
We'll keep tearing down tyrants,[N]
whether that's Cidor or Cythes[N]
or Korovai or Byelen Himself.[A][N]
That's the ideal I've chosen,[N]
and it's the one I'll cling to[N]
even if the world burns around me.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
With a cause like that,[N]
you don't need money[N]
for money's sake, Boro.[A][N]
All you need is your lance[N]
and an unflinching hand.[A][N]
Think you can take those into[N]
battle against the Pitviper?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat][OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]I think I can after[N]
all. My thanks, Cleo.[A][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]
It was nothing.[N]
For the Liberators.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]For the Liberators, indeed.[A][X]

## Chapter21Intro_AxleChat
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAlex]
[OpenMidRight][LoadAxel]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]
Hey, Axel?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yeah, Alex?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Since we're back in Chouwouj,[N]
do you think we might run[N]
into the rest of our family?[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]
Probably not.[A][N]
Lexa lives on the southern[N]
coast, nowhere near here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Huh. That makes sense. Not[N]
sure why I bothered asking.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Eh, it's good to think[N]
about stuff like this.[A][X]

## Chapter21Intro_KassandraSus
[OpenMidRight][LoadKassandra]
[MidRight]
Hm[Beat]?[A][N]
Why did I fly all this[N]
way to some remote island?[A][N]
This is halfway to Chouwouj![A][N]
I'm supposed to be at Fort[N]
Eduardo in Cythes, not-[A]
[FarFarLeft][ToggleColorInvert]
Hello, Lady Kassandra.[A][ToggleColorInvert]
[MidRight]
Who goes there?[A]
[FarFarLeft][ToggleColorInvert]
I am He.[A][ToggleColorInvert]
[MidRight]
That voice[Beat] that power[Beat]![A][N]
You[Beat] you must be[Beat][N]
Lord Byelen Himself?[A][N]
How[Beat]? Why would you[N]
come to me like this?[A]
[FarFarLeft][ToggleColorInvert]
You need not know, Lady Kassandra.[A][N]
But I offer you a boon[N]
and an offer in twain.[A][N]
You will get your revenge[N]
on Lord Elias and his sister.[A][N]
You will rise through[N]
the ranks of Cythes.[A][N]
Join me, and do my bidding[N]
upon this crumbling realm.[A][ToggleColorInvert]

## Chapter21PostPreps_1
[MidLeft][LoadKwame]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadLoewePunished]
[FarRight]
I see the fortress on the horizon[Beat][N]
It's almost the size of a city.[A][N]
The Pitviper is somewhere inside[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
See the villages around here?[N]
Each one is the home of one of the[N]
warlords we'll want to recruit.[A][N]
We'll need to [ToggleRed]go to each of[N]
them[ToggleRed] and do whatever they[N]
need to get their help,[A][N]
then [ToggleRed]report back[ToggleRed] with[N]
news of our success.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Whatever they need?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Aye. They'll likely demand[N]
some gift or help from us[N]
in return for their aid.[A][N]
[ToggleRed]It would be a very bad idea[N]
to enter the fortress[N]
without recruiting them[ToggleRed].[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
I see. Let's get[N]
to work, then.[A][N]
We'll sweep through the mountains[N]
and recruit whoever we can.[A][X]

## Chapter21PostPreps_2
Once you're ready, have Loewe or[N]
Cleo [ToggleRed]Seize[ToggleRed] the switch outside[N]
of the fortress to enter it.[A][N]
Be sure that all your units are[N]
[ToggleRed]ready to act[ToggleRed] and [ToggleRed]dismounted[ToggleRed][N]
from their steeds first![A][X]

## Chapter21PostPreps_3
[MidLeft][LoadVinny][ThreeLineBox]
[ToggleSmile]Hahahahaha! Forwards,[N]
soldiers of the Pitviper![A][N]
The Warlord Masala will die[N]
today, at the hands of the[N]
tactical mastery of me![A][N]
Me, Vinny von Theodosian![A][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight][LoadValere][TwoLineBox]
Nngh[Beat][A][N]
This situation grows worse[N]
and worse by the moment.[A][N]
Our dream cannot die here,[N]
and so soon, and yet[Beat][A][N]
If only another force[N]
would come to our aid,[A][N]
[ToggleRed]we would be deeply grateful[ToggleRed].[A][N]
Hold the line, knights! If[N]
we die, we die with glory![A][N]

Hey, you! Hostage girl![A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]What is it?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You know what'd be funny?[A][N]
You're gonna put one[N]
of our uniforms on.[A][N]
So if your mother's soldiers[N]
ride up, they'll think you're[N]
one of ours and kill you![A][N]
How's that for[N]
a perfect plan?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I'd rather not-[A]

Hahaha! I am a genius![N]
Now put that cloak on![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]Huh. This uniform is[N]
surprisingly comfortable.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I know, right?[A][N]
When the Pitviper told me[N]
she gave these to all of[N]
the Death Rattle guards,[A][N]
that was almost enough to make[N]
me sign up just on its own![A][N]
[Beat]On that note, do[N]
you want to join us?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
You're holding me hostage[N]
and threatening to kill me.[A][N]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I am Lady[Beat] no, just call me Dart.[A][N]
The Pitviper's troops kidnapped me[N]
from my home and held me hostage.[A][N]
If you're here to free me,[N]
you have my thanks.[A][N]
My family lives in the[N]
village to the southwest.[A][N]
I'd like to head home,[N]

## Ch21Thieves_CephAlive

[MidLeft][LoadCephalid][ThreeLineBox]
Looks like there's a new warlord[N]
trying to make a claim in[N]
the Himbasha mountains[Beat][A][N]
I don't like this.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Me neither, boss.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I didn't ask about you.[A][N]
We're gonna take that[N]
new warlord down,[A][N]
but I don't think[N]
I can do it alone.[A][N]
We'll need an alliance.[A]
[MidRight]
What do you mean, boss?[A]
[MidLeft]
I think we can bribe the[N]
Pitviper to come protect us.[A][N]
We're already nearly[N]
allied with her anyway.[A][N]
Go [ToggleRed]run to her fortress[ToggleRed] and[N]
take this tribute to her.[A][N]
[ToggleRed]Don't get distracted by fighting[ToggleRed].[A]

## Ch21ReinfWarnText
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
I see movement inside[N]
Taraji's fortress.[A][N]
Reinforcements are about[N]

## Ch21_ExplainMasala
In order to sway Warlord[N]
Masala to your side,[A][N]

An alliance against[N]

My apologies, but that's not[N]
quite a risk I'm willing to take.[A][N]
Taraji's just a mite too[N]
dangerous a foe for my blood.[A][N]

How about a little gift[N]

You don't quite have the[N]

Come back when you're[N]

But I must relay this news with[N]

The Pitviper's troops are[N]

There's a [ToggleRed]tunnel[ToggleRed] in the wall[N]
of the eastern guard tower.[A][N]
It's just by the stairs.[A][N]
It's a mite cramped, but it'll[N]

You are not the son of me[N]

The Silent One came to us[N]

[FarRight][OneLineBox]
He[Beat] what? I don't understand.[A]

The true Seed of Byelen, the girl[N]
Coralia, could not restore the[N]

due to some form of defect.[AN]
Byelen's descent to human form[N]
made him infertile, I believe.[AN]
In order to resolve this crisis,[N]

We belonged to a faction that[N]

I know not if he still[N]
remains among the Lorekeepers.[A]

He cannot have.[A][N]
Mithras claimed he had[N]

once we reached Chouwouj.[A][N]
I know not where he is now.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I doubt that will work.[A][N]
There's[Beat] some sort of[N]
magical protection on her.[A][N]
She is much more than[N]
she was at Fort Kreiss.[A]

The four ancient weapons[N]

Come, for you are awaited.[A][X]

That woman serves Byelen, and she[N]
stole the legendary weapons[Beat]?[A][N]
No, no. This can't be happening.[A]

If Coralia is another Seed,[N]
and she's traveling in Cythes,[A][N]
then they may mean to perform[N]
one of the rites with her.[A]
[FarLeft]
Elias and Trajan are doing their[N]

[Right]
Our course is set.[A][N]
We need to deal with our[N]
business here in Chouwouj,[A][N]
then set off to Cythes[N]
as soon as we can[A][N]
to put an end[N]
to all of this.[A]

the Seed of Byelen[Beat][A][N]
[OpenEyes]No. I cannot falter here,[N]
after all we've been through.[A][N]
We must stop Cythes, and[N]
the coming calamity.[A][N]
For everyone I care about.[A]
[MidRight]
Well said, Loewe. Your[N]

[Beat]Mom.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I've no more secrets[N]

You've grown into a[N]

If it is any forgiveness for how[N]
I've treated you all this time[Beat][A][N]
let me draw my blade and swear[N]
myself to the Decian Liberators.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Truly?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Everything I have done may be[N]
difficult to put past us[Beat][A][N]
letting you think I was dead,[A][N]
hiding so much about[N]
who you truly are[Beat][A][N]
but let this moment[N]
at least be a start.[A][N]
I'll make it up to you, somehow.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]I would be honored to have you[N]
back after everything, Mom[Beat][A][N]
I'll show you everything[N]
I've learned with the sword,[A][N]
and tell you everything the Decian[N]
Liberators have gone through.[A][N]
Maybe we'll never have Dad,[N]
or Dragana, or our homes in[N]
Wustheim or Linoras back[Beat][A][N]
but we can leave the past behind,[N]
and go on to build a better future.[A]

And for the rest of[N]

Mom?[A]

It's[Beat] [CloseEyes]not what I expected[N]
vengeance to feel like.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]There was the glorious burning[N]
satisfaction, just for a moment,[A][N]
but now I just feel[Beat] [CloseEyes]empty.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
[CloseEyes]I'm sorry.[A][N]
If it helps, [OpenEyes]we still have[N]
so much to do here now that[N]
the Pitviper's reign is over.[A][N]
We can start establishing peace[N]
treaties with the other warlords,[A][N]
rebuilding the cities that[N]
were destroyed by-[A]

That's not[Beat] not[N]
what I mean, Tikka.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
I don't understand.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I think I might get it.[A][N]
She's built her whole life[N]
around wanting revenge,[A][N]
and now doesn't have the[N]
chance to want anything else.[A][N]
Even you two, and[N]
you're her family.[A][N]
It wasn't revenge for me, but[N]
I've[Beat] [CloseEyes]felt the same way, before.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
[Beat]You speak true, Boro.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
What about Byelen?[A][N]
Didn't you always say you[N]
knew He would save you?[A]
[Right]
Byelen[Beat][A][N]
If what the Liberators[N]

[Beat]Remember this, Dart.[A][N]
Letting a single past[N]

it will lead you to ruin.[A]
[FarLeft]
I'll try.[A][N]
[Beat][OpenEyes]So what is it you're[N]
planning on doing now, Mom?[A][N]
Chouwouj is peaceful again.[N]
There's no need for more fighting.[A]
[Right]
[Beat][OpenEyes]I must go with the[N]
Liberators to Cythes.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
[OpenEyes]Are you sure, dear?[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Yes. With the way my[N]
faith has been shaken,[A][N]
that is the only place[N]
I can find it resolved.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]I am sorry.[A][OpenEyes]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]If you must[Beat] that's fine.[N]
I trust you to do what's best.[A]
[Left]
And I as well, my love.[A][N]
I will remain here and see to[N]
the restoration of Chouwouj.[A][N]
When you return, it will be[N]
to a land you can be proud of.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
[OpenEyes]You don't have to do it alone.[A][N]
I'd be happy to stay behind[N]
and help keep this place[N]
under control as well.[A][N]
We still don't know where[N]
the true heir is, right?[A][N]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
We do not. The warlords are[N]
the only rulers that remain.[A][N]
[FarRight]
It's a heck of a problem, huh?[A][N]
I'll need to go tell the Liberator[N]
bosses that I'm staying here,[A][N]

Hey, Cleo.[A][N]
Now that Taraji's dead, the political[N]
situation in Chouwouj is going wild.[A][N]
Her empire's breaking apart, and[N]
the surviving warlords and generals[N]
are figuring out what to do.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat] see.[A][N]
But we don't have time[N]
to stay behind and-[A]
[MidLeft]
You don't.[N]
But maybe I do.[A]
[MidRight]
Hm?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Remember what we[N]
talked about earlier?[A][N]
Politics is still something[N]
I can wrap my head around.[A][N]
I'll stay behind in Chouwouj and stop[N]
the whole damn jungle from burning[N]
while getting everything cleaned up.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
If you think that's how you'd[N]
best aid the cause[Beat] very well.[A]
[MidLeft]
And maybe once things can[N]
handle themselves here,[A][N]
I'll rush on over to Cythes and[N]
join y'all there for the end.[A][N]
Or maybe not. Time's[N]
a heck of a thing.[A]

Do what you think[N]
would be best, Boro.[A][N]

The hike through the tundra[N]
up here was[Beat] difficult.[A]
[MidRight]
We've made it safely, though.[A][N]
Coralia, your research said Byelen[N]
was most likely near here, right?[A]
[FarLeft]
Correct. Perhaps within the city,[N]
or perhaps just somewhere nearby.[A][N]
I don't know enough to tell.[A]
[Left]
Then the three of us will[N]
go inside and investigate.[A]
[MidRight]
Actually, just the two[N]
of you. I've another idea.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Oh?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
My face is well known as a[N]
leader of the Liberators,[A][N]
and my looks and accent are[N]
obviously Decian besides.[A][N]
It'd be too dangerous for me[N]
to show them in Gechrysos.[A][N]
I'll head to the coast and try to[N]
help Cleo and Loewe arrive safely.[A]
[Left]
Very well.[A][N]
Goodbye, Sir Trajan. May[N]

All of the competent city guards[N]

The ones we met are only[N]
those too cowardly for that.[A]
[MidLeft]
I suppose that makes sense.[A]
[MidRight]
Well, we're back in the capital.[A][N]
It's good to reside behind[N]
these ancient walls once more.[A]
[MidLeft]
The streets look strangely[N]
quiet[Beat] Where has everyone gone?[A][N]
I doubt it's merely conscription.[A][N]
Even the children and[N]
civilians are sparse.[A]

[Beat]I don't know.[A][N]
But I'd imagine it could be[N]

Ever since a few days ago,[A][N]

it lets me do far better[N]

He's certainly within[N]
Gechrysos, at least.[A]
[MidLeft]
With the missing citizens[Beat][A][N]
they're probably connected,[N]
one way or another.[A][N]
But what would His human[N]

[MidRight]
Maybe He intends to be there[N]
when the ritual happens?[A][N]
I don't know how a[N]
god's mind works.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Neither do I. But let's[N]
continue to search[N]
the city, at least.[A][N]
Perhaps another good[N]
place to look would be[N]
the Imperial Palace?[A][N]
As the Emperor's granddaughter,[A][N]
I think I can still[N]
safely get us in[Beat][A][X]
