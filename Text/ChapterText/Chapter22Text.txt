Trajan?! Is that you?[A]

Cleo, Loewe! I thought it[N]
might be you when I heard[N]
all of the fighting going on.[A]

[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
What are you doing here, Trajan?[N]
I thought you were with[N]
Coralia and Elias in Gechrysos?[A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
We can discuss that after[N]
we've shook these Cytheans.[AN]
And besides, I've been out[N]
of action for far far too long.[A]

[Right][TwoLineBox]
Good point Trajan, it's[N]
good to have you back.[A]

[MoveMidLeft]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Ah, there you are! I've been looking for[N]
you. We're nearly at the Cythean coast.[A]


[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[CloseEyes]Indeed we are.[A]


[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
We were going to discuss strategy if[N]
you'd like to[Beat] to uh[Beat] hey, Cleo?[AN]
You look[Beat] pale. You're not gonna[N]
get all seasick on us, are you?[A]


[MidRight]
[OpenEyes]W-what? No! I'm not ill, I'm just[Beat][AN]
It's[Beat] been a long time[Beat][A]


[MidLeft]
Ah, right. I should've figured as much.[N]
That was[Beat] insensitive of me.[A]


[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
It's alright. I knew this day would[N]
come eventually, but I thought I could[N]
prepare myself for when it arrived.[AN]
Now that I'm here, though[Beat] I[Beat][N]
can't shake this horrible feeling[Beat][A]


[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Is it that different from the fighting[N]
we've already been through, really?[AN]
We've fought the Cytheans for so long![A]



[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
And it never got any easier. At least,[N]
not enough to ever feel[Beat] normal.[AN]
This time, I won't be protecting people.[AN]
We're[Beat] we're invading them, Loewe.[N]
Families, innocent men, local militia.[N]
Ordinary folks, fighting for their homes.[AN]
For[Beat] for my home.[A] Or[Beat] maybe not.[AN]
Maybe now, it's no different than Freyse[N]
or Mahemen or Chouwouj; a nation to some,[N]
but just another battlefield for us.[AN]
But if Cythes is no longer a home[N]
to me, then[Beat] then that means[Beat][A]


[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Cleo. What is a home to you?[A]


[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat] it's[Beat] I suppose it would be the[N]
place where my life is, so to speak.[AN]
Where I can feel grounded; where those I[N]
care about are nearest; where I belong.[A]


[MidLeft]
But isn't that what the Liberation is?[N]
Isn't this where you belong, now?[A]


[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I[Beat] it doesn't[Beat] really[Beat][A]



[MidLeft]
O-oh. I see.[A]



[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I'm sorry, Loewe. I know that's not the[N]
answer you wanted to hear, but I just[Beat][AN]
I don't mean to imply that I feel[Beat][N]
that is to say, I'm not[Beat] er[Beat][A]


[MidLeft]
Don't worry, I, uh[Beat] I get it. I do.[AN]
But[Beat] what about your father?[A]


[MidRight][OneLineBox]
My father[Beat] he's[Beat] not the same.[A]


[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat] I'll meet you below decks. We'll[N]
probably just start if you don't show.[A]


[MidRight]
Right. Don't trouble yourself on my[N]
behalf, please. I'll be okay.[A]


[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I hope that's true[Beat][A]


[ClearFace]

My father[Beat] he's waiting for me, too.[AN]
I hadn't even considered[Beat][A][X]

[MidRight][LoadKwame]
[FarFarLeft][LoadLoewePunished]
[MoveLeft]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Sorry I'm late, Kwame..[A]


[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
It would not be the first time,[N]
but no matter. I thought you[N]
were going to go retrieve Cleo?[A]


[Left][TwoLineBox]
She's[Beat] working through something[N]
right now. She'll be here[Beat] maybe.[A]

[MidRight]
I[Beat] see. Not much of a meeting then,[N]
is it, with just the two of us alone?[A]


[Left]
It does sort of feel that way, huh?[AN]
Ever since we left Boro behind, things[N]
have been so[Beat] quiet. I kinda hate it?[A]


[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I assure you, had this been an eventful[N]
boat ride, we would likely be sunken at[N]
the bottom of the Cythean sea by now.[AN]
It's a lucky thing the intel we used[N]
was accurate; a chance encounter with[N]
the Cythean navy could've lost this war.[A]


[Left][ThreeLineBox]
We would have found a way out.[N]
We always do, don't we? But[Beat][AN]
This will sound sappy as all hell,[N]
but for all the foes I've defeated,[AN]
I've never been able to win in[N]
battles against my own inner[N]
demons without all of your help.[AN]
Now, the shoe's on the other foot,[N]
and[Beat] I just don't know how to help.[AN]
I just[Beat] left her above deck[N]
to figure things out herself.[A]


[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Well[Beat] you could try[Beat] er[Beat][A]

[Left]
You don't know either, huh?[A]


[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Th-there are few things I do not know.[AN]
Wisdom is simply the act of recognizing[N]
that which is beyond your own ken.[A]


[Left][OneLineBox]
And this is one of them?[A]


[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Precisely.[A] Listen well, Loewe;[N]
not every battle is yours to fight.[AN]
Cleo already has the answers she needs.[N]
She will find her way again soon. All[N]
you need do is what you've always done.[A]


[Left][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Brooding[Beat]?[A]


[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I would thank you not to. No, Loewe;[AN]
just be there for her, as you've been[N]
since we started this journey, and as[N]
she's done for you countless times.[A]


[Left][OneLineBox]
But[Beat][A]

[FarFarLeft]
What happened to discussing strategy?[A]

[FarFarLeft][LoadCleo]
[MoveFarLeft]
[Left]
Cleo![A]


[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[ToggleSmile]Ah, there you are. I was beginning[N]
to worry you weren't coming.[A]


[FarLeft]
Ah, then I must be mistaken; surely, you[N]
two have been hard at work, yes?[AN]
What have we discussed so far? Troop[N]
movements? Allocation of supplies?[AN]
Do you even have a map of the city?[A]


[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[ToggleSmile]I, ah[Beat] we were simply[Beat][A]


[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Wasting time? Flapping your gums?[N]
Come now, we've a war to plan, don't we?[A]


[MidRight]
Yes, of course, you're right.[N]
Now, let us begin with-[A]


[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
The intel I've just picked up.[A]


[MidRight]
Oh?[A]


[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
I may have gone for a little bit of a,[N]
uh, recreational flight on my pegasus.[AN]
And I think, before we discuss too much[N]
further, you two should come with me.[A]


[Left][OneLineBox]
Why? Did you find something?[A]


[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
You could say that. Come on, we should[N]
hurry; he'll surely be on the move.[A]


[ClearFace]
[Left]
You heard her, Kwame.[N]
Let's get a move on![A]
[ClearFace]


[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[OpenQuote]He?" Who has the girl found, I wonder?[A][X]




## Ch22BeginningScene3

[MidLeft][LoadKwame]
[Left][LoadLoewePunished]
[MidRight][LoadCleo][OneLineBox]
It should be just over this way.[A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Y-you two[Beat] fly like this[Beat][N]
every day? H-how!? Why!?[A]

[Left][OneLineBox]
What's wrong, Kwame? Afraid of heights?[A]

[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
C-could you at least consider slowing[N]
down? Spare an old man some courtesy[Beat][A]

[Left]
Aww, come on, what's a little fresh air[N]
gonna do? You're, what, like, a thousand?[AN]
Don't you think you should live a little?[A]

[MidLeft]
I've lived a great deal, Loewe. Long[N]
enough to know I h-hate flying![A]

[MidRight]
Are you two done back there? We're[N]
coming up on what I saw earlier.[A]

[Left]
We appear to be at an impasse, so[Beat][N]
yeah, I guess we're pretty much done.[A]

[MidLeft]
[OpenQuote]An impasse." Kids these days[Beat][A][X]




## Ch22BeginningScene4


[Left][LoadCleo]
[FarLeft][LoadLoewePunished][TwoLineBox]
Alright, Cleo, I trust you and all, but[N]
this looks like an empty forest to me.[A]


[Left]
Yeah, yeah; he's around here somewhere.[N]
Maybe if make a bunch of noise?[A]

[FarFarRight][LoadKwame]
[MoveMidRight]
[MidRight]
Cleo, perhaps you should explain what[N]
we're meant to be looking for out here?[A]

[Left][OneLineBox]
And ruin the surprise?[A]


[FarLeft]
Oh, great, she's finding this fun, Kwame.[A]


[MidRight]
Children and their games[Beat][A]


[FarFarRight]
All of you, keep it down, would you!?[A]


[FarLeft]
Wait, is that[Beat] No way![A]
[MoveFarFarRight][CloseSpeechSlow]
[ClearFace]
[Left]
Hey, wait up![A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[MoveFarFarRight]
[ClearFace]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
And off they go, again, leaving an old[N]
man to hobble off after them as usual.[A][X]




## Ch22BeginningScene5

[FarLeft][LoadLoewePunished]
[Left][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Hey.[A]

[FarLeft]
Trajan![A]

[MidRight]
How's it going, Loewe? Miss me?[A]

[Left]
It's good to see you again.[A]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Right back at you, Cleo. Though, maybe[N]
you could have found a more inconspicuous[N]
way of reuniting? It's not safe here.[A]

[FarLeft]
But[Beat] What are you doing here?[N]
I thought you were supposed to be with[N]
Coralia and Elias in Gechrysos?[A]

[MidRight]
We can discuss that later; there's[N]
Cytheans on my trail, and if they didn't[N]
know I was here before, they do now.[A]

[Left][OneLineBox]
W-wait, you're being followed? And I-?[A]


[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
It's too late now; It was gonna have to[N]
come to blows eventually. At least this[N]
way, I have some friends backing me up.[AN]
And besides, I've been out[N]
of action for far far too long.[AN]
A good old-fashioned scrap could do[N]
me some good, wouldn't you agree?[A]


[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadKwame][TwoLineBox]
As nice a reunion as this is, we can't[N]
fight here; our forces are still at sea,[AN]
and we can't afford to take risks when[N]
we're so close to the end of this war.[AN]
Trajan, you should accompany us back to[N]
the boat; we'll be arriving soon, and-[A]


[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Thanks, old timer, but no thanks.[AN]
If you guys don't wanna fight here,[N]
you should just head on back, and I[N]
can just meet up with you in town.[A]


[Left][OneLineBox]
Um[Beat] is that not[Beat] reckless of you?[A]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Cleo, the entire reason I'm out here is[N]
to draw their forces away from where[N]
they're supposed to be. I'll be fine.[AN]
You three, on the other hand, have a[N]
mission to attend to. Don't you worry;[AN]
I'll be right behind you. Promise.[A]

[Left][OneLineBox]
We're in a boat.[A]

[MidRight]
I have long legs.[A]

[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
He's clearly made up his mind. Well,[N]
I wish you luck in this[Beat] endeavour.[A]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
And I wish you the same. Don't worry,[N]
it'll take more than some stray Cytheans[N]
to stop me. I'll meet you at port![A]

[ClearFace]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
I can see where you two get[N]
your headstrong streak from.[A]


[Left][TwoLineBox]
Yeah, we learned from the best.[AN]
Though, if they know Trajan is here,[N]
the port will likely be heavily guarded.[AN]
We may be in for a fight once we land.[A]

[FarLeft]
Best to head back quickly, then,[N]
so we can prepare for battle.[A]

[Left][OneLineBox]
Right. Let's get back on the pegasi.[A]

[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
O-oh, right. The pegasi. Perhaps I[N]
should have asked to stay behind[Beat][A][X]

## Ch22CleoPostPreps

[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
Okay, stay calm, Cleo. It's just another[N]
battle; it's just like all the rest.[AN]
Even if you recognize the streets[Beat][N]
or the f-faces[Beat][A][CloseEyes] it's just[Beat][A][X]





## Ch22EndingScene1


[Right][LoadLoewePunished]
The fighting's stopped[Beat] Looks like[N]
we won. How's everyone holding up?[A]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
The port is secured, and our forces[N]
have all made landfall safely.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadTrajan]
A couple scrapes, but nothing major.[N]
It's good to be back in the fight![A]
[Left][LoadCleo][OneLineBox]
I'm[Beat] glad we made it out okay.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat] ahem. Trajan, it may do the men[N]
some good if you come speak to them.[AN]
They'll be gladdened to see their leader[N]
on the front lines with them, no?[A]
[FarLeft]
Ah, perhaps you're right. Morale is[N]
crucial, especially in enemy territory.[AN]
When I get back, I'll explain how I[N]
got separated from the others.[A]
[ClearFace]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Cleo[Beat][A]

[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Sigh[Beat] be at ease, child.[N]
You are not here alone.[A]
[ClearFace]
[Left][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[Right]
Uh[Beat] Are you[Beat] feeling alright?[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
I said something unkind. On the boat.[N]
I just want to apologize for implying-[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
No, Cleo, I told you. I understand.[AN]
It's[Beat] complicated. Family, that is.[AN]
I still don't really know how I ought to[N]
feel about Catrin[Beat] about my mother[Beat][AN]
It must be hard, coming home to a place[N]
that you love, knowing that it holds[N]
somebody you hate within its walls.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
[Beat] Yeah.[A] I don't know.[AN]
He's an[Beat] awful man. Truly.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
And yet[Beat][A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
And yet, indeed. He's still my father.[N]
If he were any other man, I'd hate him.[AN]
I still do, even. But it's not clean.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Do you know if you're ready to face him?[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
[Beat][A] Maybe.[A] I have a feeling[Beat][N]
the words will come when I see him.[A][X]

## Ch22EndingScene2


[MidRight][LoadTrajan]
[MidLeft][LoadKwame]
[MidRight]
So that's the full story. I couldn't[N]
risk Coralia getting caught, so[Beat][AN]
we split up. I decided to come meet you[N]
here, to establish a foothold in town.[AN]
As far as I'm aware, the two of them[N]
have already arrived in the city by now.[A]
[MidLeft]
I see. How[Beat] confident you are in[N]
your abilities to do such a thing.[A]
[MidRight]
Ahaha, you think me a fool? Let me tell[N]
you, Kwame; there are no sensible rebels.[AN]
Only a fool would fight in this war,[N]
and only a coward would choose not to.[A]
[MidLeft]
Is that right? I suppose I am glad[N]
to be in the company of fools, then.[A]
[MidRight]
Damn right.[A] Heh, you know[Beat][N]
those kids really look up to you.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
They[Beat] do they now?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I can't say I trusted you the first time[N]
we met. I don't think they did, either.[AN]
But, with Dragana gone[Beat] they needed[N]
somebody to keep them from unraveling.[AN]
I'm glad you were there for them, when[N]
they needed somebody the most.[A] Thanks.[A]
[MidLeft]
I-I[Beat] You are most welcome, Trajan.[AN]
I don't presume to be a good role model,[N]
but[Beat] I believe in them. Very much so.[AN]
If anyone can pull it off, it's them[Beat][A][X]

For the last year things up here have[N]

We're pretty cut off from the rest[N]

It even started snowing a couple of[N]
