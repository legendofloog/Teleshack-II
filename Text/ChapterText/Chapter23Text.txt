That so[Beat] Gotta say, it's a bit odd[N]

Not just civilians, either. After[N]
Mahemen's rebels retook Wustheim,[N]
Cythean soldiers came here all at once.[AN]
Seems like the top brass think their[N]
best shot is concentrating all our[N]

Something big's going on, Ulrich,[N]

Hm[Beat] So that's why no one's around[N]

That explains why so many soldiers are[N]
needed here in the capital, at least.[AN]

Still, something seems odd.[N]
Is ceding so much ground and opting for[N]
a siege worth the costs incurred?[AN]

It's tough to say, but either way,[N]
things are heating up. Even though it[N]

What is your defense, Lady Coralia?[A]
[FarLeft]
I[Beat] Kassandra attacked us both[N]
in Mahemen, Grandfather. Elias[N]
is the only reason I survived.[AN]
I feared that if we made our way[N]
in through normal means, she may[N]
make another attempt on my life.[AN]
[FarRight]
A fair assumption. To tell the truth,[N]
I've long suspected foul play on her[N]
part. Guards, seize Dame Kassandra![AN]
[Right]
No, that won't be necessary, Orfeas.[N]
Your granddaughter speaks true, but[N]
part of her story has been left out.[AN]
Our Lorekeeper brethren reported[N]

Oh? You know that much? Perhaps you're[N]
more interesting than I expected,[N]
noble pup. Yes, I am Byelen![AN][.7][.7]
Though, I suppose you could have[N]
called the man in control of this[N]
body "Mithras," not too long ago.[AN]
He was[Beat] well, he no longer holds[N]
sway over this body. For many, many[N]
years, I've tried to regain control,[AN]
but all of my avatars stood strong.[AN]
That is, until Mithras chose not to[N]
claim a Seed and aimed to end the cycle.[N]
A fool to the end[Beat] One I must thank.[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
So you've finally come out of hiding?[N]
You saved us some trouble looking, then.[N]
Why are you amassing people in Gechrysos?[AN]

You haven't already realized? Not the[N]

What is your guess, Lady Coralia?[AN]

correct? If you have those and[N]
thousands of people at your disposal[Beat][AN]
[Right]
It seems you have an idea, so allow[N]
me to fill you in. I aim to reverse the[N]
Rite of Eternity and revive the heroes.[AN]
They will be the immortals they always[N]
should have been[Beat] under my control,[N]
unlike when they nearly overpowered me.[AN]
[Left]
Wait[Beat] Overpowered you? The last[N]
person who could claim that is Abalone IX,[N]
the last emperor of the old empire.[AN]
[Right]
Indeed, I am He. The blessing of[N]
Byelen I spoke of was no delusion.[AN]
Even so, the heroes were powerful enough[N]
to bring me to my knees! Defeated as I[N]
was, I couldn't control the cycle,[AN]
so thanks to them, my future avatars had[N]
their own will. At least, until now.[AN]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Humor me, Byelen. What is your[N]
intent in resurrecting the heroes?[AN]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Well, before you two came waltzing in,[N]
I thought they would aid me in the fight[N]
against the wielder of the Kaiserschwert.[AN]
But now that the girl is here, I can use[N]
them and the defective Seed before me[N]
in order to restore my divinity.[AN]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
I[Beat] I'm the Seed? Like Loewe?[AN]

Not quite. He's a false one, but he at[N]

What kind of magic can accomplish this?[AN]

Ah, an excellent question that I'm[N]

It has taken many, many milennia for[N]

And now, I intend to make Byelen pay.[AN]
Take advantage of the emperor's doubt[N]

I agree, Loewe, but if we rush in there[N]

Well, you two are the Cytheans. I'm[N]

[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Well, you lot took weeks taking the[N]

[Beat]Turns out politics is almost as[N]
complicated as fighting a millenia[N]

Constant arguing between warlords,[N]

Well, I stuck around long enough.[AN]
Chouwouj won't burn at least,[N]

Besides[Beat] I wouldn't want Dragana[N]

Boro can handle himself, but I took down[N]
way more soldiers on the way here![AN]

It's not a competition[Beat] And if it was,[N]
I won! Mahemen's rebels beat the both of[N]

The Sacred Arrow Rebels[Beat][N]
They're nearby, then?[AN]

Yeah, they're causing a huge stir by the[N]

I ran into one of 'em. Kailani, right?[N]
Anyway, she said we should press on[N]
and that they'd catch up if they could.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Then[Beat] They're on our side?[N]
Even after the Mureib business?[AN]

I don't know about that, but they[N]

Can't say what they wanna do after,[N]

I'll hold off from fighting just yet.[N]
Gotta save all my strength for Byelen![A]

But if we don't fight here, we can't win.[N]
We have to stand up and show them how we[N]

I have to show them that it doesn't matter[N]
why I was born, or whether or not I'm the[N]

and came to understand Cythes's sin.[N]
Perhaps you would have too, Mihail.[AN]
[MidLeft]
If I had made a different choice[Beat][N]
Yes, perhaps. Regardless, we stand[N]
opposed. What do you plan to do to me?[AN]

Swear never to oppose us again,[N]

Just my word? Isn't that a bit[N]
naive, Cleo? I could lie to you and[N]
come back with the rest of the guard.[AN]
[MidRight]
But you won't. I think you can see that[N]
we mean no harm to ordinary Cytheans.[AN]
Our opponents lie within the palace,[N]

all that I had done, good and bad.[AN]
I resolved to never fight again[Beat][N]
But Kassandra had other plans.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadCleoAngry]
[Beat]Do you think it's that easy?[N]
That you can just "reflect"[N]
and have all wrongdoing erased?[AN]
You must've hurt so many as a knight[Beat][N]
Why? What sent you down that path?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Are you asking me,[N]
or your brother?[AN]
[MidRight][LoadCleo][OneLineBox]
[Beat] [Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Either way, the answer's the same,[N]
isn't it? To protect our family.[N]
He had you, and I[Beat] had Cid.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Cid?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Well, it's of no concern to you.[N]
So, what's your plan here?[AN]
Kill me? Let me go? Keep me captured?[N]
You don't have time to waste here[N]
if you want to make Orfeas's head roll.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Yes, which is why I'll let you go.[AN]
You don't seem the type to come back[N]
and make me regret it, Sir Viktor.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][TwoLineBox]
Ha! Got me all figured out, do you?[N]
Well, as thanks, you can have this.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][OneLineBox]
Hm? A staff?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
It was a gift from the girl you let[N]
escape, but I have no use for it.[N]
I never focused much on staves.[AN]
Anyway, this one supposedly can steal[N]
something right out of an enemy's hands,[N]
if the user has enough magical power.[AN]
I doubt you can use it, though.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Yes, it's quite advanced, but still,[N]
thank you. We'll put it to use.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Mhm. Well, that's it for me. I'll go[N]
pack my bags and hoof it to Mount[N]
Sarloos until you're all done.[AN]
No sense in sticking around[N]
and risking my neck, right?[N]
Good luck, though. You'll need it.[A][X]

Weren't you close to my uncle?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Yes, we were, but after my injury,[N]
Orfeas and his advisors labeled me[N]
a failure without my sword in hand.[AN]
Rumors traveled of my supposed disloyalty[N]
to Cythes's cause, and Cidor, well[Beat][AN]
He cut me loose to save Selese's name,[N]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Is that why you never came back?[N]

No exile could stop me from seeing you.[AN]

Much better than being stuffed in[N]

Regardless, I couldn't let Orfeas[N]
find out about my trips to Decia,[N]
so I only watched my family from afar.[AN]
That was all[Beat] that I could do.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I still cannot forgive you, Father.[N]
Even so, I at least understand now.[N]
If[Beat] If I survive this last battle,[N]
I would like to speak to you again.[AN]

You[Beat] should come back to see Mother.[N]

Hm[Beat] Well, if you insist, Tiberius,[N]

How did you come across such a weapon?[AN]

I have my ways. Well, I'm sure you can[N]
figure out how to use it, Tiberius.[AN]
I won't waste any more of your time,[N]
so stay safe until everything's over.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Wait a second[Beat] I'm certain of it.[AN]
This sword is just like the one that[N]
man gave to Iskra back in Freyse[Beat][AN]
Was[Beat] my father supporting us,[N]

Why[Beat] Why did you leave me?[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
I watched our son bleed out.[N]
[Beat]He died because of us.[AN]
Our shallow pride in Cythes[N]

we passed it down to our son.[AN]
My unerring belief that all[N]

So I ran. I ran as far as I[N]
