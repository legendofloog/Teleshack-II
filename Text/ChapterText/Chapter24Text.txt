[MidLeft]
[Beat] Cleo[Beat] Byelen[Beat] Orfeas[Beat][AN]
What[Beat] do I do? None of this is right,[N]
yet[Beat] there are no other options[Beat][A]
[FarFarRight][OneLineBox]
Having second thoughts?[A]
[MidLeft]
Who's there? Show yourself![A][Event]
[FarFarRight][LoadMysteryMug]
[FarFarRight][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
My, my, so jumpy. Afraid of having[N]
your thoughts be known, Leonidas?[A]
[MidLeft]
Y-you! My deepest apologies, I did[N]
not mean to offend! I simply-[A]
[MidRight]
Hahahaha! Calm yourself. A god cares[N]
not for the trifles of his followers.[AN]
I take no offense, believe me.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
T-then[Beat]?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You miss your daughter, yes? You wish[N]
to meet her again, before the curtain[N]
is drawn on this whole farcical affair?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat] Your will is paramount, Lord.[N]
Mine is[Beat] just that of a man.[A]
[MidRight]
Indeed? And what makes you think that[N]
I would be remiss without your aid?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Pardon?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You are, as you say, a mere man. I do[N]
not care about your feelings, nor is[N]
your presence required.[A] You're a tool.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Why[Beat] are you telling me this?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Hm! You may think me unkind. I simply[N]
detest[Beat] unnecessary niceties.[AN]
Today, however, is a momentous day, and[N]
I feel that exceptional days beget[N]
exceptional conduct, don't you agree?[AN]
And so, I will allow you a kindness.[AN]
Go to her.[A] The Decians surely have[N]
her by now, and your assistance here is[N]
no longer needed. Does this please you?[A]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat] I don't understand! I know all[N]
your plans! Your troop numbers, your[N]
battle formations, your[Beat] all of it![AN]
You would release me into the arms of[N]
your foes at this most critical time[Beat][N]
just for a change of pace!?[A]
[MidRight]
If you know my plans, then you would[N]
know that there isn't a power on this[N]
plane that could stop them now.[AN]
I have all the pieces I need right here.[AN]
If the Decians approach, they will only[N]
expedite the ritual with their arrival.[AN]
If the Decians lie in wait, then they[N]
will fall before my Four Heroes.[AN]
And if they leave[Beat] then they will[N]
have left! Hahaha! It's oh so simple.[AN]
Nothing you do can stop what's been[N]
set in motion; your fate is sealed.[AN]
But, in return for your service, I will[N]
allow you this briefest of liberties;[AN]
Die with your daughter, where I can't[N]
hear your ceaseless fevered muttering.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]

[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I[Beat] I have to get out of here[Beat][A][X]

[FarRight][LoadElias]
[Right]
There you two are! Always with your[N]
tense conversations in hushed tones;[AN]
I'd hope whatever business you had to[N]
discuss has been concluded, then?[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Indeed. Loewe has[Beat] made his choice.[A]
[FarRight]
And? Has he chosen to forsake our home?[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
No. No, I[Beat] I know what I have to do.[AN]
Cythes can't be allowed to fall to ruin,[N]
lest all of Orodreth fall with her.[AN]
No, the[Beat] the only choice I can make[N]
is to fulfill the destiny chosen for me.[AN]
I will become the next Byelen.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Well, that's wonderful news![A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Indeed. I had hopes you would choose[N]
differently, but that you made the[N]
choice at all is what's most important.[AN]
Truthfully, I feared that you would[N]
perhaps falter in your convictions.[AN]
I'm proud to see how far you've grown[N]
since we first met all those moons ago.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
My convictions[Beat] Yes, of course.[AN]
We came here to put a stop to tyranny.[AN]
This is the only way to ensure that[N]
Orodreth can live on, free of chains.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
And what of the risks involved?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Worry not, Cleo. I have offered him my[N]
knowledge and insight. With the power of[N]
a god, he can create new failsafes.[AN]
Should such a day ever come, he will[N]
have provided man with all the tools[N]
they need to replace him themselves.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
And how can we ensure that these tools[N]
are only employed by the righteous?[AN]
And[Beat] What will happen to Loewe if he[N]
becomes a god? He won't[Beat] stay, right?[A]
[Left]
No[Beat] My body here will fade away.[AN]
I'll go on to live[Beat] wherever[N]
it is Byelen lives, I suppose.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'm glad you made the right choice.[AN]
I admit, I was worried that perhaps[N]
you still harboured some resentment[N]
towards my people over this war.[AN]
Thank you for giving us this chance.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Yes[Beat] We must always look forward.[AN]
We can't stay stuck in the past anymore.[AN]
We have to[Beat] find our own future[Beat][N]
and claim it with our own two hands.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'm going to check on Coralia. The last[N]
battle was hard on her[Beat] I can't[N]
imagine what she must be going through.[A]
[FarLeft]
If you don't mind, I've a mind to join[N]
you. Her insight into her grandfather may[N]
prove invaluable in the coming battle.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Certainly! Let us away, then.[A][X]

## Ch24_LoeweCleoSadTalk

[MidLeft]
Hah[Beat] He's in high spirits.[AN]
Suppose that's what a little bit of[N]
hope will do after so much strife[Beat][A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Feels good to be at the end, huh?[AN]
It will take some time to rebuild, but[N]
hopefully[Beat] Hopefully, the world is[N]
made a better place by our actions.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Loewe.[AN]
Stop putting on a brave face for me.[AN]
The others might not be able to see[N]
through it, but I know you better.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Nothing gets past you, huh?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
You don't want to be Byelen. You don't[N]
want any of this. You want to live.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat] That may be true. But I don't have[N]
the luxury of choice anymore, do I?[AN]
I haven't for a long time[Beat] hell,[N]
I haven't since the day I was born.[AN]
Catrin, Kwame, Byelen[Beat] They all knew[N]
this day would come. That one day, I[N]
would take the mantle of godhood.[AN]
Mom raised me, Kwame plotted, Byelen[N]
made moves to shore up his own power[Beat][AN]
and I didn't even know I was a player[N]
in this game of gods and kings.[AN]
This is my role to play, and I'll play[N]
it with all my heart to the bitter end.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Your role to play[Beat] Loewe-![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I don't want to hear it, Cleo.[AN]
It[Beat] it'll just make my decision[N]
that much harder to bear. Just[Beat][AN]
make sure my Mom is safe when I'm gone.[A]

What are you two doing here? I thought[N]
you'd left to check on Coralia.[A]

We did. We were interrupted by an[Beat][N]
unexpected visitor, one could say.[A]
[MidRight][MoveRight]
[Event]
[FarRight][LoadLeonidas]
Ah[Beat] You must be Loewe. I've heard a[N]
great deal about you through our spies.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
"Our" spies? Who exactly are you, then?[A]
[Right]
Uh[Beat] meet my father, General Leonidas.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Leonidas!? Is this a trick? Has he been[N]
searched? Was he followed? Do we know-[A]
[Left]
Peace, Loewe. He is unarmed and alone.[AN]
More importantly, he has a great deal[N]
to share with us[Beat] about Byelen.[A]
[FarRight]
I will tell you all I know[Beat] but only[N]
after you bring me to my daughter.[AN]
I[Beat] it's[Beat] been a long time.[A]
[FarLeft]
[Beat] Alright. I'll bring you to her.[AN]
Elias, come with me. Kwame, make sure[N]
Trajan and Boro know the situation.[A]

Of course. I will ensure our forces are[N]
ready to advance deeper into the city.[A][X]

I[Beat] You[Beat][A]
[Left][MoveRight]

I am[Beat] not angry with you. Not now.[N]
Not with all that's happened since[Beat][AN]
Since Byelen first appeared to us.[AN]
You needn't fear me; the war is ended.[N]
I come here not a soldier, but a father.[AN]
One who[Beat] has made a grave mistake.[A]
[FarRight]
Cleo, do you[Beat] need some space?[AN]
I can take him away for a while, until[N]
you're ready, if that's what you want.[A]
[FarLeft]
[Beat] No. There's no need for that.[AN]
I will handle the situation as I am.[AN]
Father. Or[Beat] General Leonidas.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Cleo[Beat][A]
[FarLeft][MoveLeft]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Under your tutelage[Beat] you forged me[N]
into a mighty blade of the Empire.[AN]
You taught me that might was the law[N]
that governed this world and its people.[AN]
That to be strong was to have power,[N]
that to have power was to be righteous.[A]
[Right]
Yes[Beat] This is what gave our nation[N]
its grand legacy over so many centuries.[AN]
Yours was to be the next chapter in that[N]
tale of heroism and victory! So why[Beat]?[A]
[Event]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Why did I leave? Because you were wrong.[AN]
The walls of Gechrysos were built not of[N]
Cythean stone, but of foreign bone.[AN]
Our crops fed by corpses, watered by[N]
blood; our entire livelihood, built on[N]
war, tyranny, bloodshed[Beat] atrocity.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Cleo, I don't understand[Beat] I-[A]
[Event]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
You sent me to the frontlines as your[N]
perfect little toy soldier, but I was[N]
naught but a girl in a woman's armour.[AN]
And what I saw out there on the field[N]
of battle was the true face of our home.[AN]
Your philosophy writ large, signed in[N]
red ink with a conscript's steel quill.[AN]
Children killing children while their[N]
fathers drink wine at home[Beat] and[Beat][AN]
It made me so god damned angry to see[N]
you in my mind's eye, dagger in hand,[N]
blood on your fine silk garments,[AN]
lecturing me on what it means to be[N]
a strong warrior. How laughable![AN]
That you, of all men, think yourself to[N]
be the strongest of the strong[Beat][AN]
Yet all the while, you were too weak to[N]
worm your way out of Orfeas's grasp.[A]
[Event]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Please[Beat] these things you are saying,[N]
they are[Beat] naive! You can't possibly-[A]
[Event]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
And still, with your vaunted Emperor[N]
poised to slaughter his own people to[N]
appease a withered, desperate corpse,[AN]
you continue to cling to his ideals.[AN]
To his Empire.[A] To his damned teat![AN]
And in your fear you come crawling to[N]
me, with your talk of grave mistakes?[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
I[Beat] I[Beat][A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
[Beat] Damn it! Get this man out of my[N]
sight. He[Beat] he makes me sick![A]

[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Cleo? Are you-?[A]
[Left]
Loewe![A]
[Left][MoveMidLeft]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
O-oh, I didn't mean to startle you.[N]
I just[Beat] would you rather be alone?[A]
[MidLeft]
No, no. I mean[Beat] I was[Beat] ahem.[AN]
Perhaps I was[Beat] too harsh.[AN]
Maybe some time to sort my thoughts out[N]
before we spoke would have been prudent.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Is any of what you said untrue?[A]
[MidLeft]
No[Beat] I meant every word of it.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Then[Beat] I wouldn't worry about it.[N]
You said what needed to be said.[AN]
I suspect you've wanted to say that[N]
for a long time now. Am I wrong?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hah[Beat] No, you've the right of it.[AN]
That man[Beat] made me into somebody[N]
I detest being. It's taken everything[N]
I have to be a better person. Every day.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
But it's working, is it not?[AN]
The way I see it, the person he taught[N]
you to be[Beat] that wasn't you, Cleo.[AN]
Fighting for Decia[Beat] Standing up to[N]
him after so long[Beat] that's you.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] Kwame really is rubbing off on you.[AN]
You sound just like him, sometimes.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Who, me? No way I sound that old.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Perhaps soon you'll start carrying your[N]
own book of lore, to crack open every[N]
time you're feeling extra mysterious.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Now that you mention it, the eyepatch[N]
definitely gives off that kind of vibe.[AN]
Maybe he planned that part, too?[A]
[MidLeft]
Hah! He must've felt lonely, being the[AN]
world's oldest living cyclops and all.[A]
[MidRight]
Hahaha, his master plan's finally borne[N]
fruit after so much preparation![AN]
Hahaha![A]
[MidLeft]
Hahaha![A] Hah[Beat][A] [Beat][AN]
I[Beat][A] We're gonna miss you, Loewe.[A]
[MidRight]
Heh, yeah, I[Beat] I know. I'll[Beat][AN]
I'll miss you guys too.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] We should[Beat] probably get going.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Yeah[Beat] the fight's not over yet.[AN]
Let's go, Cleo; one final battle.[A][X]

## Ch24_ThePlan

[FarLeft][LoadCleo]
[Left][LoadLoewePunished]
[Right][LoadTrajan]
[FarRight][LoadBoroScarred]
[Right]
Ah, good. You're here. We just received[N]
some crucial intel from a defector.[AN]
You're never gonna believe this, but-[A]
[FarLeft]
We know! Er, that is[Beat] We've already[N]
been appraised of his[Beat] arrival.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Ahem. What did we learn, Trajan?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Well[Beat] as you know, approaching the[N]
catacombs is easier said than done.[AN]
I don't understand the specifics, but[N]
Kwame tells me that this ritual of[N]
Byelen's prevents us from entering.[AN]
If we do, we'll just become another[N]
part of its death toll when it finishes.[AN]
However, we can't just wait out here;[AN]
if the Four Heroes take to the field,[N]
we'll be helpless to fight back.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
And I'm assuming Leonidas has given[N]
us some kind of alternative approach?[A]
[FarRight]
That's right. Quite the good timing, I[N]
must say. We were in a real rut![A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Leonidas says Byelen placed some kind[N]
of protective ward on his person, to[N]
prevent the ritual from killing him.[AN]
However, if we travel alongside him, its[N]
effects should extend to all of us.[AN]
In short, he can smuggle us into the[N]
ritual chamber so we can disrupt it.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Are you sure we can trust his word?[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Kwame checked him; he definitely has[N]
traces of Byelen's magic all over him.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
And, respectfully, we don't have other[N]
options. The way I see it, if it's a[N]
trap, we're just back where we started.[AN]
I fancy our chances of trying to stop[N]
that ritual before it completes more[N]
than trying to fight those Heroes.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
The Four Heroes[Beat][A]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Yes, indeed. Boro has the right of it.[AN]
Should we be forced to face off against[N]
the Heroes, we will surely perish.[AN]
Even but one of them would match the[N]
strength of an army in their prime;[AN]
With all four of them[Beat] Orodreth[N]
with tremble and break before them.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
What do we know about them?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Well, two of them you've met before;[AN]
Eitha, wielder of Daybreak, is said to[N]
have aim so true she could shoot the[N]
very stars out of the night sky;[AN]
Hamdi, wielder of the Titan's Fang,[N]
once defeated an entire fleet by rending[N]
the very seas themselves in twain.[AN]
The others will be new to you;[AN]
Theimon, wielder of the Svarog, was[N]
known to have such power over life that[N]
he could raise the dead with but a word;[AN]
and Danu, wielder of the Worldcleaver,[N]
had a swing so powerful that he carved[N]
great mountains and canyons with it.[AN]
Their powers, granted to them by their[N]
mighty weapons, afforded them the power[N]
to oppose Abalon IX[Beat] Byelen himself.[AN]
And now[Beat] he plans on controlling them.[A]
[FarLeft]
And once he's done using them to defeat[N]
us, he's going to kill them to return[N]
to his[Beat] more heavenly form?[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Byelen does not reside on our world[N]
naturally. He exists[Beat] elsewhere.[AN]
Heaven is as good a name for it as any[N]
other we have, but it's[Beat] complicated.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
I suppose[Beat] I'll be seeing it for[N]
myself before long. Maybe I can[N]
tell you guys what it's like some day![A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[FarLeft]
[Beat] Y-yeah! I'll hold you to it, okay?[A]
[Left]
Then[Beat] it's a promise.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Well, unless anyone has any objections,[N]
I think we put our faith in Leonidas.[A]
[FarLeft]
I'm[Beat] loathe to admit it[Beat] but[N]
you're right. We've no other choice.[A]
[Right]
And, if he does betray us, we'll just[N]
have to fight them on their terms.[AN]
If we can defeat them before they can[N]
finish this ritual of theirs[Beat][A]
[Left]
You're right. This is our best shot.[AN]
Then[Beat] assemble the troops.[AN]
Tonight, we dethrone a god.[A][X]

It's so dark in here[Beat][A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Strange. The torches are lit, but it's[N]
like their light is being[Beat] suffocated.[A]

I don't like it[Beat][A]

Not to worry! Stick close to me, and[N]

[MidLeft][LoadCoralia]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][LoadElias]
Coralia? Is that you? I-I[N]
can't quite see in here[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
Ah[Beat] yes, I'm here. You startled[N]
me, Elias! Were you looking for me?[A]
[MidRight]
I was. I wanted to ask you something.[AN]
Permit me, if you will, to breach station[N]
and speak to you as a traveling companion.[A]
[MidLeft]
As equals, then? Whatsoever[N]
is the occassion, Elias?[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat] Your grandfather waits within the[N]
catacombs, likely by Byelen's side.[AN]
We will likely have to face him,[N]
and[Beat] possibly kill him, as well.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] Yes. I am aware of the possibility.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I just wanted to say[Beat] if the need[N]
arises, I will not hesitate, Coralia.[AN]
Even if you order me not to, if it's for[N]
the good of Cythes, I'll kill him myself.[AN]
I figured I should tell you, so you are[N]
prepared when[Beat] if[Beat] the time comes.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Is that all you came here to say?[A]
[MidRight]
I[Beat] No. I wanted to check on you.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Sigh[Beat] Elias, you don't need to play[N]
the gallant knight. We're Liberators, now.[AN]
I can hold my own, just as you can, and I[N]
will do as I must, just as you will.[A]
[MidRight]
Then[Beat] you have steeled[N]
yourself for the end?[A]
[MidLeft]
I have. I am gladdened to hear that you[N]
have as well. Cythes needs us, Elias.[AN]
All of Orodreth needs us. If Orfeas stands[N]
in our way, you needn't face him alone.[AN]
We'll face him and Byelen both together;[N]
the Liberators of Decia and Cythes both.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat] Heh. It wasn't too long ago that[N]
you balked at my blunt countenance,[AN]
yet now I find myself in your place.[A]
[MidLeft]
Perhaps we've simply taken a page out of[N]
one another's proverbial books, no?[AN]
I trust that I can rely on that honest[N]
counsel of yours after the war, as well.[AN]
I'll have need of it if we are to[N]
rebuild Cythes without Byelen's grace.[A]
[MidRight]
Of course. I will serve Cythes until the[N]
day I die, just the same as you will.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] Knowing I can rely on you makes[N]
facing that uncertain future[Beat] easier.[AN]
Come, we shouldn't dally; I'm amazed I[N]

Leonidas here is of mankind. And like[N]

You've seen it, time and again.[AN]

So petrified was he of my inevitable[N]
ascension that he longed for the life[N]
he had neglected to build for himself.[AN]
The loving daughter he so scorned[Beat][AN]
And so, I gave it to him, knowing that[N]
once he knew how lost that life was to[N]
him now, that he would do as man does;[AN]
Destroy it.[A] And so, he would bring[N]
you here, where had I asked him to do[N]

I'm[Beat] not sure. It looks like[Beat][N]
my old village. But it's not. I think[N]
this is[Beat] my mind? My soul? Our soul?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Ours? You mean[Beat] you foolish boy.[AN]
All that talk of rebellion, and yet[N]
you've accepted me into your heart?[A]
[MidLeft]
Not quite. I don't plan on becoming[N]
the next Byelen, now that you're here.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Oh?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Tell me how you made the Seeds. I have[N]
a theory[Beat] it came to me when we[N]
arrived here. Perhaps in merging,[AN]
I've gained some of your knowledge[Beat][AN]
But I want to hear it from you.[AN]
And, since we're the same now, you[N]
will tell me[Beat] You can't keep[N]
secrets from yourself, after all.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat] My power, as God of this world,[N]
is dominion over life itself.[AN]
I implanted a great sliver of myself[N]
into the very fabric from which all[N]
life in Orodreth is woven from.[AN]
When enough life is made, and enough[N]
of my mana is drained in so doing,[AN]
this sliver creates a new Seed for me.[A]
[MidLeft]
Yes[Beat] that was as I suspected.[AN]
So then[Beat] Does that mean that, if[N]
you're here, I can use your powers to[N]
also[Beat] rewrite the laws of life?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
You could, yes. But[Beat] you do know[N]
what's happening to you back in Orodreth?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Of course. Time may be frozen there, but[N]
once that instant has passed[Beat] you[N]
will take your place in my body.[A]
[MidRight]
And, in so doing, whatever changes you[N]
make will be mine to undo. So what good[N]
does this conversation do you?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Simple; I don't intend for you to return[N]
to Orodreth when we're finished here.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
What? You would kill me here, within[N]
your own soul, knowing the havoc it will[N]
reap upon Cythean soil? You lie![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Who said I'm doing anything so brash[N]
as killing you? I'm simply going to[Beat][AN]
reappropriate your power in a more[N]
productive way.[A] MY way.[A] Not Kwame's.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
And what, exactly, do you plan to do?[AN]
You could, perhaps, create a Seed in[N]
your own image, but such an act would do[N]
little to stop what's already in motion.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I don't plan on just making a new Seed.[A][X]

Hah, I[Beat] I think so[Beat][A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Impossible. Cease this, Byelen. There[N]
is no way the boy could survive that.[A]
[MidLeft]
Sorry to disappoint, Kwame, but[Beat][N]
it's definitely me. So, uh[Beat] hi.[A]
[Right]
I thought[Beat] I thought you were[Beat][N]
I was so worried that you'd[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
So was I. I can't believe it actually[N]
worked. It[Beat] was pretty stupid of me,[N]
if I'm being totally honest.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Loewe.[AN]
Where is Byelen?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Gone. And he's not coming back, either.[A]
[Right]
What!? But what about Cythes![A]
[MidLeft]
Don't worry! I took care of that too.[A]
[Right]
But[Beat] But how?[A]
[MidLeft]
I, uh[Beat] rewrote[Beat] reality?[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
[CloseEyes][Beat] The boy has rewritten death itself.[N]
And he used Byelen's soul to do it.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Kwame[Beat]?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Everyone alive today, and everyone who[N]
will ever be born, has been granted a[N]
sliver of Byelen's power, am I right?[AN]
I can sense it. You've turned all of[N]
mankind into miniature seeds;[AN]
their deaths will release mana, slowly,[N]
bit by bit, to renew the blessing.[AN]
Then, through the blessing, that mana[N]
will enter new life, such that their[N]
deaths will repeat the cycle forever.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
You did that? Really? How? That's[Beat][N]
it's unbelievable! And[Beat] amazing! But-[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Hang on a sec, Cleo.[A] Kwame?[A]
[FarRight]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
How did you know that?[A]

[MidLeft]
I have toiled[Beat] and waited[Beat] and[N]
suffered[Beat] for so many lifetimes.[AN]
Everything I have done, I did in order[N]
to see the events of this day through.[AN][OpenEyes]
And you[Beat] threw all that away[Beat][N]
in a single,[.4] willful,[.4] petulant instant.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Your eye[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
This? A facade. Like everything else.[N]
My name, my goals, my history[Beat][AN]
You knew Kwame to be a false name. What[N]
made you think Athanasius was any truer?[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Then[Beat] Who are you, really?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I am not the fourth immortal. That man[N]
lives in the Kaiserschwert, slain over[N]
a millenia ago on the first day.[AN]
I took his place; founded the Lorekeepers[N]
to help steer history to my design;[AN]
manipulated Byelen's avatars to keep[N]
him weak and feeble. All for naught.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
If you're not the fourth immortal[Beat][N]
nor a mortal man[Beat] Then you're[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
A god.[AN]
I am Cherne; lord of all that which[N]
Byelen's rays leave untouched.[AN]
Keeper of all knowledge, and student[N]
of all there is to know in this world.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Impossible[Beat] that's impossible![A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat] I had my doubts about you, Kwa-[Beat][N]
I mean[Beat] Cherne. But I thought I was[N]
simply being paranoid. All this time[Beat][AN]
What was your endgame in all of this?[A]
[MidLeft]
Simple. I was tired of living, in a very[N]
literal sense, in Byelen's shadow.[AN]
So it was that I assumed the form of a[N]
mortal man, confining my divinity to[N]
dormancy. "Cherne, the Dead God[Beat]"[AN]
I implanted myself as Abalon IX's most[N]
trusted advisor, and manipulated him.[AN]
It was I who helped him forge the four[N]
legendary weapons all those years ago.[AN]
It was I who allowed the heroes to steal[N]
them, who helped them defeat the king,[AN]
and who taught them the ritual known[N]
only to me to achieve their immortality.[AN]
And it was I who sabotaged it, granting[N]
this form the immortality I needed.[AN]
And so I waited for the blessing to[N]
run dry[Beat] for Byelen to descend[N]
from the heavens and become a mortal,[AN]
just as I had. And that was when you[N]
were born, Loewe. The instrument of my[N]
grand ascension to Byelen's throne.[AN]
The god of both light and dark[Beat][AN]
I could have been the ultimate being.[AN]
And you[Beat] you[Beat] ruined it![A]
[FarRight]
This is insane! You're telling me that[N]
this[Beat] all of this[Beat] it was all[N]
your doing? From the very first moment?[A]
[Right]
[Beat] So what now, "Cherne?" Byelen is[N]
gone, and your plan has failed. Is that[N]
why you're telling us all this?[A]
[MidLeft]
No. I'm telling you because you deserve[N]
to know the fate that awaits you now.[AN]
Byelen is not gone, you fool; He lives[N]
on in every man's soul, now. You turned[N]
all of mankind into Seeds, remember?[AN]
If I wish to claim him for myself,[N]
I will have to extricate him from every[N]
last human being in Orodreth.[AN]
Starting[Beat] with you.[A][X]

And with that, all four immortals are[N]

I had hoped that, once Byelen's power[N]
had become mine, you would help me to[N]
shepherd the new world I will create.[AN]
Alas, Byelen lives within you both.[AN]
Your death, then, is inevitable; I am[N]
truly sorry that it had to end this way.[A]
