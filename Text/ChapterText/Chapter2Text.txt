[MidLeft][LoadLoewe][ThreeLineBox]
By Byelen! How large can these[N]
dungeons be? This is the manor[N]
of a nobleman, not a prison, right?[A]
[MidRight]
Actually, I believe this manor is[N]
a converted keep, from before[N]
the Reclamation Wars.[AN]
Decia was forged out of one of the[N]
collapsed kingdoms from those times.[AN]
The architecture and stonework of[N]
this area indicate as such as well.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]What? I learned[N]
it as part of my studies.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Must have been a real fancy school.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Something like that.[A][X]


## Chapter2OpeningScene2
[MidRight][LoadVarga]
[MidLeft][LoadSoldier][ThreeLineBox]
Honestly, how incompetent must[N]
Raschwitz have been, to let those[N]
Liberation dolts in on his watch?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
And now they're running around in[N]
these godforsaken dungeons, and[N]
they'll be sure to head this way,[AN]
if they're after Kasun![A]

[MidRight][LoadVarga]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Er[Beat] Not that I don't appreciate[N]
you not alerting the rest of the[N]
guard, sir, but what was that?[AN]
It was like you two had[N]
practiced that move before.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
We did.[A]
[FarLeft]
What? How-[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
The general's cell is ahead. And you[N]
know that the chances of this escape[N]
failing increase the longer you take.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Very well, I'll save[N]
the questions for later.[A]
[Left]
[ToggleMouthMove](...[....]As will I. Varga, how[N]
could you possibly be here?)[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

[MidRight]
[Beat][A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Captain Tyr, oughtn't we be[N]
more on guard, what with the[N]
rebels running around?[A]
[Left]
Why should we? We know they'll have to[N]
head this way, and when they do, I'll[N]
personally end their miserable lives![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[ToggleMouthMove](...[....]Loewe...[....]Cleo...[....] don't[N]
lose to this useless fop.)[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

Oh lord[Beat][A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
What a fantastic idea it was,[N]
holding that protest![A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Delilah[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I mean, look at this fancy room[N]
they set up, just for me! I've[N]
got dark walls to stare at,[AN]
dripping water to tell the time[N]
by, and not one, but two rats![A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Will you just- Look, you're[N]
free now. You can go back home.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
And what are you doing, then?[A]
[MidLeft]
I've joined the Liberators.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Then I'm joining too. You owe me[N]
too much to run away that easily![A]
[MidLeft]
Ugh[Beat] Fine, we could use the[N]
help. Look, here's a spare staff.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]What, no-[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
They did not bring an extremely[N]
rare light tome for their[N]
breakout plan, no. Honestly,[AN]
is using those the only[N]
reason you became a sister?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Maybe?[A][X]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Oh, so you're one of those Liberators,[N]
huh? I bet you're expecting me to[N]
thank you for saving me, huh? Sorry,[AN]
but I'm too pissed at that idiot[N]
Svetomir for getting me into this mess-[N]
I can't wait till I see him. Oh,[AN]
do you have any spare staves or light[N]
tomes? I might as well use 'em, because[N]
I ain't going back to that prison cell.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Just a staff.[A]
[MidRight]
Good enough, I guess[Beat][A][X]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Well, well, well. Aren't you[N]
two a sight for sore eyes.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
It's good to see you well, General.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
As if a spineless fop like Cidor could[N]
break me. That being said, though,[N]
this cell isn't exactly pleasant.[AN]
Let's get out of here, yeah?[A]
[Left]
Don't need to tell me twice.[N]
I'll go make sure everyone's[N]

Y-Yes, General?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Good job, seriously. I knew I[N]
made the right decision making[N]
you and Loewe my adjutants.[AN]
You all practically didn't[N]
even need me, am I right?[A]
[FarLeft]
Please don't talk like that, General.[N]
Putting aside how inaccurate that is,[N]
you're just tempting fate.[A]
[MidRight]
Ha! Fate's got another thing[N]
coming if it thinks it'll be[N]
taking me down any time soon.[A]
[FarFarLeft][OneLineBox]
You may wish to rethink that, general.[A]
[MidRight]
What-[A][X]

Did you really think you[N]
would escape that easily?[A]

Silence! It seems your execution[N]
will need to be moved up![A]

A-after them![A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Oh? I don't think so. I'd like to[N]
have a word with your boss, so I'm[N]
afraid you'll have to go through me.[AN]
So come on, if you'd like to[N]
test yourself against my lance.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Boro-[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Save it. My position hasn't changed.[N]
