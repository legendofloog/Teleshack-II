## Chapter2Title
Ch2: On Tattered Feet[X]

## Chapter2Tutorial
Support points rise when two units are[N]
deployed on the same map (like PoR).[AN]
When a unit targets an enemy, allies with[N]
overlapping attack range and a Support[N]
give bonuses to the attacker (like 3H).[AN]
Some units provide different bonuses[N]
to each other, depending on pair.[AN]
The amount can be seen by pressing R[N]
on the Support for the pair of units,[N]
shown on the 3rd stat screen page.[A][X]

By Byelen! How large can these[N]
dungeons be? This is the manor[N]
of a nobleman, not a prison, right?[A]
[MidRight]
Actually, I believe this manor is[N]
a converted keep, from before[N]
the Reclamation Wars.[AN]
Decia was forged out of one of the[N]
collapsed kingdoms from those times.[AN]
The architecture and stonework of[N]
this area indicate as such as well.[A]

[Left][OneLineBox]
We did.[A]
[FarLeft]
What? How-[A]

do you have any spare staves or light[N]
