[MidLeft]And you're sure of it?[N]
That Kasun is truly gone?[AN]

[OpenQuote]Liberation" is over.[AN]
All that is left to do is to[N]
catch the rest of the pests.[AN]

spotted us.[AN]

too far from here.[AN]
You have to use the last[N]
of your strength.[AN]
It would be wise for us[N]
to regroup immediately.[AN]
[MidLeft]Loewe, did you[N]
drop an arrow?[AN]
[MidRight]Huh? No, I didn't.[N]
It looks like a stray arrow.[AN]
I've never seen an arrow[N]
like it.[AN]

We took care of your[N]
mounts.[AN]
[Right]Dragana[Beat] she-[.4][AN]

are okay.[AN]
Where are the[N]
others?[AN]
[Right][Beat][AN]
[FarRight]Some of the rebels[N]

things[Beat]?[AN]

[CloseEyes]We're on borrowed time.[N][OpenEyes]
[MoveRight]Let's get out of here![AN]
[FarRight]
Ballistae[Beat]? Then those[N]
stray arrows[Beat][AN]
No. Dragana's blood is on[N]
their hands.[AN]
We have no time nor chance[N]
to escape.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadLoeweAngry]
[MoveRight][.4][MoveRight]
[Right]
Cull their ranks! If we can[N]
squander their time,[AN]
we should get an opportunity[N]
to escape.[AN]
[FarRight]
Or if we can face the[N]
leader of this squadron,[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]

## Ch4EndingDefeatBoss1
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
The rest of the forces are[N]
retreating, [ToggleSmile]like the birds.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Their leader is on the ground.[N]
Do you see this, Dragana?[AN]
Cidor is one step closer. A step[N]
towards the dastard's demise.[AN]
Every sacrifice brings us[N]
closer to vengeance.[AN]
[FarFarLeft]Loewe?[A][X]

## Ch4EndingDefend1
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
They're retreating[Beat]?[N]
[ToggleSmile]Like the birds on the wind.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[CloseEyes]No[Beat] [MoveMidRight]Nghh[Beat][N]

[MidRight][LoadLoeweAngry]
Dragana[Beat]?[AN]
She wants us to avenge her[Beat][N]
I will avenge her.[AN]
[FarFarLeft]Loewe?[A][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][X]

## Ch4Ending2
[MidLeft][LoadCleo]
[MidRight][LoadLoewe]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Are you alright?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
U-[.4]Uhm, [ToggleSmile]yep.[N]
Never better.[AN][ToggleSmile]
I just had a fright from[N]
the ballistae.[AN]
But it's all okay.[N]
We will liberate Decia.[AN]
We will avenge Dragana.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Now that this is over with,[N]
we're heading towards headquarters.[AN]
Loewe, can you scout ahead[N]
for any more enemies?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
More enemies[Beat]? [ToggleSmile]Why,[N]
yes, of course.[AN]
I'll scout ahead at[N]
once, Cleo.[AN][.6][X]

## Ch4Ending3
[MidLeft][LoadCidor][Right][LoadSoldier][FarRight][LoadSoldier]
[MidLeft]
They've proven themselves to be[N]
more dangerous than I thought.[AN]
Even without Kasun[Beat] How do[N]
they have such forces?[AN]
[Right]Orders, Duke Cidor?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Forward a courier[N]
to Gechrysos.[AN]
If we can gain forces[N]
from the Cytheans,[AN]
this rebellion will[N]
be stomped out.[AN]
[FarRight]Yes, sir![A][X]

## LoeweCleoFatigueTalk
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][LoadCleo][OneLineBox]
Loewe, a word?[A]
[MidLeft]
Hm? What is it, Cleo?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
It's about our future strategy.[AN]
Now that[Beat] Dragana is gone,[N]
deciding who to deploy and where[N]
is our responsibility alone.[AN]
We have few choices right now,[N]
but once we reach our base,[N]
there are decisions we must make.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Sure, but what about it?[AN]
I was just planning on[N]
fielding our strongest[N]
fighters whenever we can.[AN]
[MidRight]
It isn't that simple, Loewe.[AN]
The two of us have a responsibility[N]
to lead the main unit at all times,[N]
but not everyone can handle that.[AN]
The rush from the jailbreak[N]
is already wearing off, so our[N]
comrades will [Red]fatigue[Red] soon.[AN]
When that happens, they'll be unable[N]
to consider anything but surviving,[N]
[Red]learning nothing from field experience.[Red][AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]True. If they're run into the ground[N]
like that, then we may not even be able[N]
to [Red]use them for the next mission.[Red][AN]
[MidRight]
Exactly. For that reason, we should[N]
keep a careful eye on our group and[N]
rotate out anyone nearing exhaustion.[AN]
[MidLeft]
You're not wrong, but there are times[N]
when it's better to leave someone in[N]
if the mission really needs them.[AN]
[Beat]I'll let you make the call, Cleo.[N]
You'll make a better choice than me,[N]
especially right now.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Very well, then.[N]
Leave it to me![A][X]

## FatigueExplanation
When allied units perform actions,[N]
their Fatigue increases accordingly.[AN]
If a unit's Fatigue becomes greater[N]
than their maximum HP, they cannot[N]
be deployed during the next chapter.[AN]
Further, any action that would give[N]
them EXP or WEXP will give nothing[N]
until they rest and reset their Ftg.[AN]
Cleo and Loewe are always deployable[N]
but can still tire out on the map.[AN]
The Fatigued status is noted by a[N]
sweat icon on the unit's map sprite.[AN]
Consider unit Ftg before deploying[N]
in order to maximize their value![A][X]
