Ch5: Like a Steamed Crab[X]

## SysTextOpening
After escaping from Selessian forces,[N]
Loewe and Cleo take the team to regroup.[N]
While the loss of their leader, Dragana,[AN]
leaves them all feeling empty,[N]
they are not without hope.[N]
Cleo and Loewe agree their best choice[AN]
is now to return to Elmhurst Island,[N]
a small enclave off the coast of Decia,[N]
where the liberation army plans activities[AN]
from the relative safety and obscurity[N]
of the sea caves. To get there,[N]
they would need to find a boat.[A][X]

## AtPort
[Left][LoadCleo][FarLeft][LoadLoewe]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]This is Port Neufchatel[Beat][N]
It's a smaller port, obscure[N]
enough for us to avoid detection.[AN]
[FarLeft]Right.[N]
We've been running for days[Beat][N]
We should have a lead on Selese[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]Then let's not squander[N]
this opportunity, Loewe.[AN]
We need to find a boat.[N]
Quickly.[AN]
[FarLeft]Right, let's split up[N]
and search.[AN]
It'll look less suspicious than our[N]
traveling with a large group.[A][X]

## SysTextMomentsLater
After searching for a boat...[A][X]

## MeetingLongxia
[Left][LoadCleo][OpenRight][LoadLoewe]
Any luck, Cleo? People are giving[N]
us suspicious looks.[AN]
I'm worried if we linger,[N]
they'll send word to Selese.[AN]
[Left]None. No one is willing[N]
to transport a group of our size.[AN]
At least, not for a price we[N]
can afford to pay.[AN]
We may need to change plans[AN]
and take a land route.[AN]
[OpenRight]A land route?[AN]
I know you're tired, too, Cleo,[N]
but that would be insane![AN]
We don't know friend from foe[N]
anymore. It's too risky![AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]Loewe, I know you're stressed,[N]
but we need to be prepared. We[N]
should always have a contingency plan[AN]
That's what Dragana taught us.[AN]
[OpenRight][CloseEyes]Dragana[Beat][AN]
[OpenFarFarRight][TwoLineBox]Oy! You lot still fancy[N]
a boat ride?[AN]
[OpenFarRight][LoadLongxia]
[OpenRight][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][LoadLoewe]Hm? It's you[Beat][AN]
I asked you about a boat no more[N]
than ten minutes ago.[AN]
Why the change of heart?[N]
We can't pay you.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]As it turns out, I have another[N]
passenger who is willing to pay.[N]
He overheard you loudmouths and[N]
took pity on you, or so I'd guess.[AN]
Can't see why else a traveler would[N]
Be willing to pony up that gold![AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]Fortuitous as it may be,[N]
I am undoubtedly skeptical.[N]
Who is willing to pay for us?[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Beats me.[N]
As long as I've got the coin,[N]
you've got yourself a boat ride.[AN]
I ain't going to wait around forever.[N]
I'm trying to shove off soon,[N]
So make a decision.[AN]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]Not sure what other choice[N]
we have. Right, Cleo?[AN]
[Left]I can't think of any better alternatives[N]
for now. Thank you, Miss.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][ThreeLineBox]You got some nice[N]
manners, girl. Call me Longxia.[N]
Follow me.[A][X]

## BoatTalk
[Left][LoadCleo][OpenRight][LoadLoewe]
[Left][OneLineBox]Loewe[Beat] how are you feeling?[AN]
[OpenRight][ThreeLineBox]Cleo[Beat][N]
I can't shake what just happened[N]
during our escape.[AN]
If only we were stronger[Beat][N][CloseEyes]
If only we were faster[Beat][N]
Dragana might still be here.[AN][OpenEyes]
[Left]Dragana's death weighs heavily on us[N]
all, Loewe. You're not alone in your grief.[N]
However, she planned for this.[AN]
You remember her orders, right?[N]
You and I will take joint charge of[N]
our remaining forces.[AN]
[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]Let's hope that two heads[N]
are actually better than one.[AN]
[OpenFarFarRight]Two heads are better than one,[N]
but have you considered three?[AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[OpenRight][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][LoadKwame][OpenFarRight][LoadLongxia]
[FarLeft][LoadLoewe]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]So, you're our mysterious patron.[N]
I am Cleo, and this is Loewe.[N]
Your generosity is appreciated.[AN]
[OpenRight]You owe me no thanks, Lady Cleo,[N]
for it may be good fortune that we've met.[N]
I can tell you've suffered a deep loss.[AN]
Perhaps a friend or a mentor.[N]
Perhaps one who was both.[N]
Am I wrong?[AN]
[Left][OneLineBox][Beat][AN]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox][Beat] Yes, we have.[N]
But what do you have to[N]
do with any of this?[AN]
[OpenRight]I've deduced that you are fleeing.[N]
The Cytheans continue to take Decia[N]
town by town, castle by castle.[AN]
Word of captured liberators escaping[N]
has galvanized those who dare resist.[N]
However, Decians remain weak and disorganized.[AN]
The Cythean's reach grows ever farther.[N]
From what I've heard, they continue to[N]
march to the deserts of Maheman as well.[AN]
With every stroke of midnight,[N]
The Cytheans claim more and more of[N]
of Orodreth as their own once more.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][TwoLineBox]
Word on the seas is that they're fixing[N]
to take the fight further south.[AN]
[Left]So conquering Decia and Maheman to[N]
establish footholds east and west[Beat][AN]
Is their plan to attack the[N]
southernmost kingdom of Chouwouj?[AN]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]Chouwouj? Sure, they have resources,[N]
but they are without a king.[N]
The royal family perished before I was born.[AN]
Chouwouj is now carved up by bands[N]
of power-hungry warlords,[N]
are carving territory for themselves.[AN]
What could the Cytheans want there?[AN]
[OpenRight][TwoLineBox][Beat] I have my suspicions, but it[N]
is not my place to say.[AN]
Regardless, I have decided to stake[N]
my lot with you all henceforth.[AN]
That's why I paid for[N]
your safe passage.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove](Paid upfront too! What a sap!)[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
[Left]So, you knew we were the liberation[N]
army all along[Beat][AN]
[OpenRight][ThreeLineBox]That's right.[N]
You certainly don't take[N]
great lengths to hide this.[AN]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]You dare mock us!?[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]Loewe, please.[N]
This isn't the time.[AN]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]Look, it all seems a bit suspect[N]
that this mysterious old man[N]
seems to know the Cythean's plans,[AN]
and was willing to take us on a boat.[N]
Something smells fishy,[N]
and it isn't the sea water.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]That's just Fangai steaming[N]
some supper for us.[N]
A fresh catch of lobster.[AN]
[Left]I'm sure that will be lovely, but[N]
this isn't the time to discuss food.[N]
I agree with Loewe's concerns.[AN]
Besides, you've yet to share your name.[AN]
[OpenRight]Ah yes, pardon me.[N]
How rude I've been to you all.[N]
You may call me[Beat] Kwame.[AN]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]Kwame[Beat][AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]So, Sir Kwame,[N]
how can we trust you?[N]
You're not Cythean, that much is clear.[AN]
You've been far too subtle with us[N]
to be on their side in this conflict.[N]
Be straight with us. What do you want?[AN]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Ho, Lady Cleo, I admire your moxie![N]
Your words strike like a knife through[N]
warm butter. Clean and precise.[AN][ToggleSmile]
This boat trip isn't just for you all.[N]
I believe that I will be of good service[N]
to you all as well. I wish to join your band.[AN]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]You can fight?[AN]
[OpenRight][ThreeLineBox]I much prefer the arts[N]
of strategy, tactics, and diplomacy.[N]
I'm sure I can serve you well.[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox][Beat] Very well.[N]
You may travel with us, Sir Kwame.[AN]
[FarLeft]Are you serious, Cleo?[N]
We don't know what he's after.[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]Loewe, we don't have a choice.[N]
He's clearly not with the Cytheans,[N]
which makes him a friend for now.[AN]
[OpenRight]As sound a reason as any, Lady Cleo.[N]
Sir Loewe, I'm sure that in time, you[N]
will come to trust me.[AN]
There is no doubt that without your[N]
intervention, all peoples of Orodreth[N]
will bend the knee to the Emperor.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][TwoLineBox]Always doom and gloom[N]
with you soldier types.[AN]
Like most common folk ain't bending[N]
and bowing to anyone holding a spear.[AN]
Come on, if you don't like lobster,[N]
I'll steam some clams for you.[AN]
The fruits of the sea, they call them.[AN]
Steam with a little butter,[AN]
some white wine,[N]
and an onion[Beat][AN]
you'll have nothing to worry about.[AN]
[FarLeft]Food does sound good[Beat][N]
Thank you, Captain Longxia.[AN]
[OpenFarRight]Pay it no mind.[N]
We better eat soon. Fog's rolling in.[AN]
[Left]You know, it does feel a tad[N]
warmer all of the sudden.[AN]
[OpenFarFarRight]Cap'n![N]
We're 'bout To get boarded![AN]
The ocean's boiling like a kettle![N]
They're gonna steam us like a crab![A][X]

[OpenFarRight][ThreeLineBox]Fangai![N]
Don't let that lobster spoil.[N]
We'll take care of this.[AN]
[OpenRight][ThreeLineBox]I'll tend to our supper below deck.[N]
You get your troops ready.[N]
As long as they don't damage our ship,[AN]
We can make it out of this alive.[N]
If we keep sailing towards the straits[N]
of Gibraltar, they won't be able to pursue.[AN]
Their ships may be too large.[AN]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]Alright.[N]
Cleo! Get ready.[A][X]

## EnemyCh5Text

[OpenMidLeft][LoadRiggan]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]Ocean's warming up and rain's[N]
about to fall.[AN]
They'll be blinded by the steam.[N]
That's when we strike.[AN]
Those traitorous dastards aren't[N]
getting out of here alive.[AN]
And if we can't do it[Beat][N]
those geysers will certainly finish 'em.[AN]
Prepare to board them![AN][CloseEyes]
More of our allies will emerge from[N]
the stairs.[AN]
That'll really spook 'em![AN]
And to top things off,[N]
just wait 'til you see the pegasi[AN]
from the south.[N]
It's a foolproof plan.[AN]
I can end it all here[Beat][AN]
This will be the moment everyone[N]
remembers Riggan for.[AN]
I'll be the hero of the Cythean[N]
Empire[Beat] Yes, me.[AN]
Mom[Beat] Shafaqat[Beat][N]
will you be proud?[A][OpenEyes][X]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
It looks like the Cythean navy is[N]
captained by a powerful mage.[AN]
It seems as if he seeks to create[N]
steam by warming the ocean[AN]
and mixing it with the falling rain.[N]
It's a clever trick, but it won't stop us.[AN]
Be careful when moving between boats,[N]
especially on the [Red]planks[Red]. If you aren't,[AN]
the steam geysers will make you regret it.[A]
[Left]
Gods, it's hot[Beat] We can take 'em.[AN]
I can shoot 'em down, but I still[N]
hesitate with my sword arm[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
That blade[Beat][AN]
Hrm, excuse me.[N]
Focus on keeping them at bay.[AN]
They will relent if we hold out long enough.[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenRight][LoadLongxia][OpenFarRight][LoadFangai]
[OpenRight][ThreeLineBox]Allow us to fight as well.[N]
Ain't gonna let the dastards ruin[N]
my ship.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][OneLineBox]I am Fangai, a traveling dark mage.[AN]
[OpenRight][TwoLineBox]Surprised you still can call yourself[N]
that, considering you mostly just like to cook.[AN]
[OpenFarRight][ThreeLineBox]There's nothing wrong with[N]
being well-versed in a number of interests.[N]
It'd do much to broaden your character.[AN]
If you cared about something else,[N]
you know, beyond this damned boat and coin,[N]
you may be a more interesting companion.[AN]
[OpenRight][OneLineBox]Pah![AN]
[FarLeft][Beat] Thank you both, let's go.[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadRiggan][TwoLineBox]

the speed of our aerial allies[Beat][AN]

They've held out better than expected.[AN]

your demise[Beat][A][X]

## LoreCh5Text
[Left][LoadCleo][FarLeft][LoadLoewe][MidRight][LoadKwame]
[FarLeft]
Finally[Beat] we made it.[N]
Thanks for all your help.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Truth be told, your army did most of[N]
the heavy lifting. I can wax poetic[N]
on the art of warfare all day,[AN]
but to fight in one is an[N]
entirely different skill.[A]
[Left]
You never did tell us how you became[N]
so knowledgeable. Typically, only nobles[N]
have access to such an education,[AN]
but any of the military men and women[N]
we've worked with learned through harsh[N]
trials and the mentorship of others.[AN]
You seem to be a different sort entirely.[A]
[MidRight]
Perceptive you are, young liberators.[N]
I knew it would be wise to stake my lot[N]
with you all. As for my education,[AN]
some may say I was fortunate,[N]
and others may say I was unlucky.[N]
It's all a matter of perspective, really.[A]
[FarLeft]
Speak straight with us, Kwame.[N]
I tire of your riddles.[N]
What are your aims?[A]
[MidRight]
The same as yours: To restore peace to[N]
this land. To end the Cytheans' plot[N]
of continental conquest.[AN]
To save the world from ruin, dramatic as[N]
it may sound. But this isn't the Mahemen[N]
opera, for we are on the stage of reality.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
So why are they doing this, then?[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Surely there's more to their[N]
plot than mere conquest.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Indeed. While they shroud their goals[N]
today in fog, perhaps history can be our[N]
guide. May I share a tale with you two?[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
A history lesson?[N]
[Beat]Alright.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Please go on, Sir Kwame.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Very well. Gather around, for a tale[N]
I will tell. Pardon me if you know[N]
stories from the book of old lore,[AN]
for it is how I came upon this[N]
tale, and from where I will recite it.[A]
[Left]
The Book of Havarti? It's the most well[N]
known account of the continent of[N]
Orodreth's origin, at least as we know it.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Havarti[Beat] He was a Maheman scribe[N]
who served the rulers of old.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Very good. You are both quite well-learned,[N]
it seems. That should make this easier.[N]
Please, I implore you to take a seat.[AN]
We may be here for a while. Now then,[N]
where to begin. There are many beginnings,[N]
in fact, but we must set the right context.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Just get on with it, please.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Do not be hasty, I am merely setting the[N]
mood. I trust the fire's crackle and the[N]
moon will provide the proper ambience[Beat][AN]
[Beat]The Cythean Empire we know today was[N]
once far grander. As humanity progressed,[N]
their great rulers fostered innovations.[AN]
That supported vast population growth,[N]
making many men and women wealthy.[N]
However, after centuries of unity,[AN]
unique cultures began to emerge in the[N]
empire, and the descendents of once wise[N]
rulers turned to malice and greed.[AN]
Generations of rulers oppressed those[N]
from the regions of Decia, Maheman,[N]
and Chouwouj, among others of Orodreth.[AN]
They whittled away at their independence[N]
and gains from the benevolent rulers of old.[N]
"Bestowed upon me," Abalone IX declared,[AN]
"is the divine right that Byelen[N]
gave to me to rule this land.[N]
You will love me. You will fear me.[AN]
It was my line whose grace summoned[N]
Byelen unto this world, and Orodreth[N]
prospered. In this hour, the land is mine.[AN] 
My subjects, I beseech you to bow down,[N]
for your kneeling will yield you fruit.[N]
Those who challenge me will perish[AN]
and suffer eternally." You can imagine[N]
how utterly insane this all sounds. The[N]
regional nobles did not take this well,[AN]
as their egos had grown alongside[N]
their pocketbooks and armies.[A][X]

## Lore2Ch5Text
[Left][LoadCleo][FarLeft][LoadLoewe][MidRight][LoadKwame]
[FarLeft]
Abalone IX was the last emperor[N]
of the old empire, was he not?[AN]
[MidRight]
Correct, but do you[N]
know how he fell?[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
History is often a messy web of myth[N]
and half-truths, but the Book of Havarti[N]
claims individual weapons defeated him.[A]
[MidRight]
You are as sharp as the blades that ended[N]
the empire, Miss Cleo. Yes, the legends[N]
would tell you that it was due to warriors,[AN]
wielding the power of weapons blessed[N]
by divinity itself. There were four[N]
weapons Havarti spoke of in his text[AN]
from secondhand knowledge: the bow of[N]
Chouwouj, the axe of Decia, the spear of[N]
Mahemen, and the sword of the Cythes.[AN]
The sword was the finest weapon of them[N]
all, but it was stolen and used against[N]
Emperor Abalone IX. He fell in battle,[AN]
and the Cythean territories retreated[N]
to their current borders.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
So, do you suspect that the Empire[N]
wants to use these weapons now?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
But they're lost to time. Even Havarti[N]
didn't know their names, only stories[N]
of their might and power.[AN]
[MidRight]
I do not know, young liberators.[N]
However, if the Cytheans wish to[N]
restore their great empire of old,[AN]
they may turn to the famed weapons[N]
to maintain their grip. The weapons[N]
Havarti spoke of were gifted to[AN]
regional lords by the Cytheans, so it[N]
only makes sense they'd seek to take back[N]
the items that ended their dominance.[A]
[FarLeft]
The entire continent ruled by Cytheans[Beat][N]
We can't let that happen. We all have the[N]
right to be free and live as we wish.[AN]
The ruled should have say in who rules them.[AN]
[Left]
If the Cytheans' march continues[N]
unimpeded, we may be doomed.[N]
House Selese betrayed Decia.[AN]
The Kingdom of Chouwouj is without[N]
their ruler or central leadership,[N]
and Mahetman forces slowly dwindle[AN]
in a battle of attrition in the sand[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
That is why I am here with you all, now.[N]
I do not wish for the restoration[N]
of the Great Cythean Empire.[AN]
For an Orodreth controlled only[N]
by the iron grip of the Cytheans[N]
will be one that is bleak.[AN]
We will never be truly free.[AN]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Freedom[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
It is you, young liberators, who[N]
may be the only chance we have.[AN]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
We have little in manpower or resources.[N]
We are fueled only by morale and[N]
a willingness to die for liberation.[AN]
[Beat]But we have to fight.[N]
We have to find the weapons[N]
and end Cythes's tyranny.[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
The weapons were lost to time,[N]
they may be destroyed.[AN]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]We have to assume they survived.[N]
It is the only way we can ensure victory.[N]
At least based on what we know today[Beat][AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Right, we must regroup and[N]
plan our next course of action.[AN]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I say we gather our forces and launch[N]
a counterattack. If we can rid ourselves[N]
of Cidor, more Decians will join us.[AN]
[Left]
It may be too soon to successfully stage[N]
such an attack. We could travel to Chouwouj[N]
and warn them of what Kwame speaks,[AN]
or we could go to Mahemen to learn[N]
more about these weapons[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
There are many choices before[N]
you both, Sir Loewe and Lady Cleo.[N]
I trust you will make the correct one.[AN]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Our choices[Beat] You've given us[N]
much to ponder, Kwame.[AN]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
We will take a few days to strategize.[N]
First, let's see how our forces are[N]
doing and regroup. From there,[AN]
we can properly weigh our options.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
A sound plan. You two[N]
should get some rest.[AN]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Very well. Goodnight, Sir Kwame.[AN]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Liberation[Beat] this is[N]
bigger than just us[Beat][AN]
[Left][ClearFace][FarLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][CloseEyes][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]It's better they don't know how[N]
poor our chances are. They have yet[N]
to lose hope in the face of adversity.[AN]
Cleo, Loewe... how will you respond in the[N]
face of true despair? Will your youthful[N]
optimism shine a light in the darkness,[AN]
or will it be doused by the power of the[N]
Cytheans? We must all overcome difficult[N]
challenges to ascend to greatness[Beat][AN]
Hm? It's been a while since I've heard[N]
that noise[Beat][CloseEyes] "The Halaka Suhaja will glow[N]
like a flame when near that which Byelen[AN]
has blessed with His radiance. Accept the 
light, for it will shield you from darkness[N]
and despair."[OpenEyes] If the legends are true[Beat][AN]
We may still have a chance. I must[N]
avenge those who died for me[Beat][N]
I will end this.[A][X]
