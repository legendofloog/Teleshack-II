## Ch5xLoeweCleoTalk
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][LoadCleo][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, Loewe, I wondered where you were.[N]
We will arrive at our base within the[N]
hour, so we should prepare to disembark.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Right. Thanks for telling me.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
You seem out of it. Are you[N]
thinking about the general?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]No, not right now. I can't[N]
allow myself to grieve and waste[N]
my energy while Cidor roams free.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Then this is about Kwame's words?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Yeah. All this talk about mythical[N]
weapons, ancient texts, continental[N]
empires[Beat] It's way beyond us, right?[AN]
Even if Cythes is our common enemy,[N]
what makes Kwame think we're[N]
the right horses to back?[A]
[MidRight]
Perhaps he has few other options.[N]
Chouwouj has no organized resistance,[N]
and Mahemen's protective sands entrap it.[A]
[MidLeft]
You're not wrong, but I still[N]
can't shake the feeling that[N]
he's hiding something from us.[A]
[MidRight]
Maybe so, but we all have our secrets.[N]
I have no right to force them out[N]
of one who would lend us aid.[A]
[MidLeft]
True enough[Beat] Thanks, Cleo.[N]
Without you around, I'm not so sure[N]
I'd be able to keep a clear head.[A]
[MidRight]
Think nothing of it. We are partners,[N]
and I also have much to thank you for.[N]
When I first defected from Cythes,[AN]
many of our comrades distrusted me,[N]
but you and Dragana welcomed me instead,[N]
at a time when no one else would.[A]
[MidLeft]
Well, I didn't know what to make of you[N]
either, at first. A highborn woman walks[N]
in and wants to join a rebellion[Beat][AN]
Sounds like the setup to a bad joke.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
H-Highborn?[.4] To be clear,[N]
I am not a noble of any kind.[A]
[MidLeft]
Even so, you're definitely no commoner.[N]
I may be curious about your past[Beat][A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
But at the end of the day, it doesn't[N]
matter. Whoever you are, you're an[N]
ally and a friend. That's enough for me.[A]
[MidRight]
Loewe[Beat] Thank you. When Decia finally[N]
casts off Cythes's yoke, I will tell[N]
you anything you want to know.[AN]
However, I have a condition.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Oh, what's that?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
You have to tell me anything I want to[N]
know, as well. Is that acceptable?[A]
[MidLeft]
Well, there's not much to say[Beat][N]
but alright. I'll take you up on that.[A]
[MidRight]
Excellent. For now, we must both[N]
survive until that day comes.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Right[Beat] Well, let's get our[N]
mounts ready. Lumi must be real[N]
tired of sitting in the brig.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Indeed. They will need time[N]
to flex their wings, after all.[A][X]

[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Yep! If I come with you, you'll have[N]
both Buck here and I by your side.[N]

you how bored I was of waiting[AN]
in the barracks for weeks,[N]
scouting around and doing nothing![A]

Yeah, you've spent all that time[N]
pestering me while I'm busy.[N]

She looks to carry a lance, which we[N]
don't have many users of. In addition,[N]
her pegasus can fly. If one of us is[Beat][AN]
unable to help, she could fight[N]
in the skies in our stead,[N]
or carry captured supplies.[A]

And her actual combat skills?[A]

Heh. About that[Beat] She's barely[N]
strong enough to lift a vulnerary.[AN]

make us worse just by being near her.[A]

hardly scratch ol' Buck here.[A]

## Ch5xStrategyRoom
[FarLeft][LoadTrajan]
[Left][LoadLoewe]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I see. It looks like the Cythean march[N]
is more dire than I thought. What do[N]
you three think our next move should be?[A]
[Left]
The obvious target is Selese.[N]
Their location provides the[N]
Cytheans with a foothold in Decia,[AN]
and their farmlands provide enemy[N]
soldiers with food. We can take that[N]
position ourselves if we kill Cidor,[AN]
along with gaining more recruits out[N]
of Selese's citizens. Before[N]
we chase after the weapons,[AN]
we need a stable position at home.[A]
[Right]
I do not disagree, but this sounds[N]
risky. After our escape, I have no[N]
doubt that Cidor will call for aid.[AN]
If General Elias intervenes, then[N]
we will have no chance of success.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Well then, what's your suggestion?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
I believe that we should look outward.[N]
Seeking out Mahemen could give us[N]
more information about the weapons,[AN]
and informing Chouwouj of the emperor's[N]
ambitions may yield new allies.[A]
[Left]
We can't rely on the promises of[N]
Chouwouj's warlords, not without a[N]
king to unite them. As for Mahemen,[AN]
can we really afford to go traipsing[N]
across the desert? I want to know[N]
more about those weapons too,[AN]
but we can't let Cidor's power[N]
continue to grow in our absence.[A]
[FarRight]
I believe an attack on Selese would[N]
be premature, but Loewe's counterpoints[N]
ring true regarding external efforts.[AN]
Chouwouj is the safer bet of the two,[N]
however. Whispers abound that a survivor[N]
of the royal family hides in the shadows.[AN]
[Left]
Rumors are just that, not something[N]
we can count on[Beat] You've been quiet,[N]
Trajan. Any ideas?[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Yes, well[Beat] You spoke of[N]
the axe of Decia, correct?[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Indeed. What of it?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Before we joined the rebellion,[N]
Dragana and I were knights of[N]
House Freyse. There's an old tale,[AN]
passed down from lord to heir,[N]
of an ancient axe that could split[N]
men in two stored beneath the ground.[A]
[Right]
Do you believe the axe resides there?[N]
If so, why would the former lord[N]
not have used it against Cythes?[A]
[FarLeft]
Even if he had, his forces were[N]
still outnumbered ten to one.[N]
No weapon could bridge that gulf,[AN]
even if he knew of its existence.[A]
[Left]
Then it may still be underground[Beat][N]
I hadn't thought of it, but Freyse[N]
was powerful even among the nobles.[AN]
A connection to the axe seems plausible.[A]
[FarLeft]
There's one more important detail. Last[N]
week, a pegasus rider returned with a[N]
report on rebel activity in Freyse.[AN]
It appears that Joakim's heir has[N]
resurfaced, along with an army that[N]
challenges the Cytheans at every turn.[A]
[Right]
If that is the case, then it seems our[N]
course is clear. The Cythean forces[N]
in Freyse are particularly strong,[AN]
so if we leave this heir to their[N]
own devices, they may perish.[A]
[FarRight]
Indeed. Even if we cannot locate[N]
the axe, House Freyse had many[N]
followers before their fall.[AN]
Success here will allow us to establish[N]
a foothold of our own, serving as a[N]
staging area for an assault on Selese.[A]
[Left]
It's settled, then. We'll sail back[N]
east and make our way to Freyse.[N]
Trajan, will you come with us?[A]
[FarLeft]
As much as I want to, my duty is to[N]
protect Elmhurst Island. You'll[N]
need a base to come back to, right?[AN]
That being said, I can lend you [Red]two[Red][N]
of the reserve troops we have on the[N]
island. Some of the recruits are[Beat][AN]
eccentric, but they can hold their own.[A]
[Right]
Thank you. Loewe, we should go survey[N]
the potential recruits. Kwame, do you[N]
mind waiting for us to choose?[A]
[FarRight]
Not at all. I will explore the[N]
base while I wait, so no need[N]
to worry on my account.[A]
[FarLeft]
Talk to me when you're done, and I'll[N]
get the boat ready for you to head out.[N]
Don't die out there, Loewe.[A]
[Left][ToggleSmile][TwoLineBox]
I wouldn't dream of it. Not until I[N]
beat you one of these days, at least.[A]
[FarLeft]
Ha, then I'll never give you[N]
the chance. Good luck, you two.[A]
[Right]
My thanks. Now, let us see these[N]
volunteers for ourselves[Beat][A][X]

## Ch5xCleoVargaTalk
[MidLeft][LoadVarga]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadLoewe]
[Right]
Varga[Beat] I'm glad you survived[N]
our escape from Selese. Why-[A]
[MidLeft]
We have much to talk about,[N]
but not in front of him.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
I'm sorry, Loewe. Could you step[N]
away for a moment? Varga is a[N]
friend of mine from Cythes,[AN]
but I cannot say more than that.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Is he an enemy of Decia?[A]
[MidLeft]
No. I am only an ally of Cleo.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Then who you are is none of my[N]
business. I'll be around, so[N]
talk to me when you're done.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[Right]
Well, now that he is gone, you need[N]
hold nothing back. Why were you[N]
masquerading as a Selesian guard?[A]
[MidLeft]
Your brother asked me to investigate[N]
your disappearance. He believed that[N]
the story of your death was unlikely,[AN]
with no corpse to prove it.[A]
[Right]
Well, I suppose that's reason enough[N]
to look for me, but again, why were[N]
you there during our mission?[A]
[MidLeft]
I know your disposition well. Loyalty[N]
to your family kept you to your duties,[N]
but everyone has a breaking point.[AN]
I was only surprised it took so long.[A]
[Right]
Can you blame me? This occupation is[N]
unjust! Emperor Orfeas commands[N]
that we take over the continent,[AN]
and anyone who stands in our way[N]
is lucky to keep their lives,[N]
let alone their homes or food.[AN]
We are no more than glorified thugs,[N]
forcing Orodreth to bend the knee.[A]
[MidLeft]
Then what of your brother? He leads[N]
these 'thugs' in Decia and answers[N]
to the emperor, as does your father.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]I do not know. Growing up, I thought[N]
that they saw everything, and if I[N]
followed the path in front of me,[AN]
I too could be of service to my[N]
country. I no longer believe this,[N]
but what do they see that I cannot?[A]
[MidLeft]
There is always more than meets the[N]
eye, my student. The people do not[N]
follow Orfeas due to power alone.[AN]
Everyone is ruled by something higher[N]
than a single man. Fear, greed, hope[Beat][N]
These ideals are what they see, Cleo.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]I have much to contemplate,[N]
but now that you have found me,[N]
what do you intend to tell Elias?[A]
[MidLeft]
That you are alive and number among[N]
the rebels. I already sent a letter[N]
while we were in Port Neufchatel.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
What now? Will you return to Cythes?[A]
[MidLeft]
No. Elias asked that I protect you.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
I see[Beat] Thank you, Varga. I am[N]
counting on your service, as always.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hmph. First, we'll need to start your[N]
training over again. You've grown[N]
soft after joining these rebels.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Uh, perhaps we can delay that-[A]

No.[A][X]

[MidLeft]
Ah, you two. Have you[N]
come for my sage advice?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
No, not particularly. Cleo, you mind if[N]
I talk to this guy alone? I've got some[N]
questions that I want him to answer.[A]
[FarRight]
I have no issue with that. Looking[N]
over our supplies before we leave seems[N]
prudent, so I will go do that instead.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Hm[Beat] Keeping secrets can cause[N]
one to harbor distrust, little lion.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
What's that supposed to mean? And for[N]
the record, you're the last person who[N]
should talk about hiding things, Kwame.[A]
[MidLeft]
Ah, my apologies. In Mahemen, I knew a[N]
woman with eyes as fierce as yours and[N]
bladework deadlier than a lion's fang.[A]
[Right]
You spent time in Mahemen, then. Do you[N]
recognize this sword? It belonged to my[N]
mother before she fell to the Cytheans.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]It is difficult to believe that any[N]
commoner could have such a blade.[N]
Who exactly were your parents, Loewe?[A]
[Right]
My father was a scholar who specialized[N]
in the history of Mahemen and its people.[N]
My mother didn't speak much of her past,[AN]
but her swordsmanship was without peer.[A]
[MidLeft]
A scholar, eh? I suppose that is how[N]
you knew of the Book of Havarti.[N]
And what is your mother's name?[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Catrin. Does that ring any bells?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]The name does feel familiar,[N]
but I can't place it at the moment.[N]
Age dulls the mind, I suppose.[A]
[Right]
Hmph. Like I'd believe that, coming[N]
from you. If you won't answer,[N]
then you've only wasted my time.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Hold a moment. There is[N]
one thing I can tell you.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
Spit it out, then.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That blade is not one of the four[N]
weapons blessed by Byelen. However[Beat][N]
it does have some kind of enchantment.[AN]
Carry it with caution, Loewe.[A]
[Right]
I'll keep that in mind.[N]
If you remember anything[N]
else, let me know.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Catrin, your son has inherited that[N]
fiery disposition of yours. Further,[N]
that blade[Beat] I'm certain of it now.[AN]
It interferes with the Halaka Suhaja's[N]
ability to detect Byelen's blessings.[N]
Why leave a child with such an item?[AN]
Is this chance, or something more[Beat][A][X]

[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[FarLeft]
Oh, you two. Have we[N]
decided on our next move?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
The heir of Freyse has returned and[N]
leads an army to reclaim their home.[N]
We decided to assist their effort.[A]
[Left]
House Freyse[Beat] It's a shame that[N]
General Dragana couldn't live to see[N]
the day that we'd help free it.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
All we can do now is make[N]
sure her death isn't in vain.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Agreed. We owe her that much.[N]
Still, I have to admit that[N]
I'm curious about this heir.[AN]
Before today, we knew nothing[N]
of them, save their existence.[N]
Lord Joakim was cautious, indeed.[A]
[Left]
Whatever they're like, I just hope we[N]
can get along. With Freyse by our side,[N]
defeating Cidor would be much easier.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Selese, eh? After we deal with this[N]
mission, they'll be our next target.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
That is true, but liberating Freyse may[N]
open up other options for us. Selese[N]
will one day have to be dealt with,[AN]
but that day is uncertain.[A]
[FarLeft]
True enough. Well, either way, I'll[N]
continue to support the two of you.[N]
Iskra, you will too, right?[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Of course. Someone has to make sure[N]
Loewe doesn't get in over his head.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Well, it's a little late for that, but[N]
I appreciate the thought. Make sure[N]
you watch out for yourself too, Iskra.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
You don't need to worry about me.[N]
I'm way stronger now, right?[A]
[Right]
You're not as weak, so from[N]
a certain point of view, sure.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
If you think that, then hurry up[N]
and teach me all your sword skills.[N]
With that, I'll far surpass you.[A]
[Right]
Fine, I'll show you a bit more once[N]
we set out. Don't complain if it's[N]
too much for you, though.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Don't worry, it won't be.[A][ToggleSmile]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
If that's all[Beat] Loewe, we[N]
should return to our duties.[A]
[Right]
Right. I'll see you later, Iskra.[N]
Mira, we'll be counting on you as usual.[A]
[FarLeft]
You got it, boss.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][Right][ClearFace][FarRight][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
So you managed to convince him,[N]
huh? You could've just asked me,[N]
Iskra. I know a sword just as well.[A]
[Left]
Maybe, but Loewe's sword style is way[N]
different from any Decian discipline.[N]
If we have more than one user of it,[AN]
it could prove remarkably useful.[A]
[FarLeft]
Well, fair enough. We'll need all[N]
the firepower we can get to take[N]
back Freyse and avenge Dragana.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Cidor[Beat] you used to[N]
work for him, right?[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Before his betrayal, yes.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Does that mean my father is a Selesian?[N]
I was born around that time, right?[A]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Yes, it does. Do you[N]
want to know who he is?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
No, I don't. If he's still on their[N]
side, then he's my enemy. The only[N]
family that matters to me is you,[AN]
Loewe, and everyone else in the[N]
Liberators. They're all I need.[A]
[FarLeft]
I'm happy to hear that, but if you[N]
ever change your mind[Beat] I'll tell[N]
you. That's a promise, Iskra.[A]

[MidLeft][LoadKwame][OneLineBox]
Well, another time, then[Beat][A]
[Event]
[MidRight][LoadMira][ThreeLineBox]
Hello there, Kwame.[N]
What were you keeping an[N]
eye on the two of them for?[A]
[MidLeft]
I intended to discuss our future[N]
strategic plans, but they seemed[N]
occupied. I thought it best to wait.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
To me, it looked more like spying.[N]
I'm quite experienced with that.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Oh? Did you work as one in the past?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
That I did. Before Cidor turned on[N]
Decia, I was House Selese's spymaster.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Fifteen years ago, then. And this event[N]
drove you into the rebellion's arms?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I heard rumblings that House Freyse[N]
intended to send two of its best[N]
knights to lead the resistance.[AN]
With that, my path was set.[A]
[MidLeft]
General Dragana[Beat] that such an[N]
extraordinary tactician fell[N]
to Cidor's plot is a true pity.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
What do you know? You're an outsider.[N]
Your words are only mindless flattery.[A]
[MidLeft]
My apolgies, but have I done[N]
anything to elicit your distrust?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Besides just now? It's more about what[N]
you haven't done. We know nothing of[N]
your capabilities or your deeds.[A]
[MidLeft]
Hm[Beat] a fair point. Well, actions speak[N]
louder than words, correct? My strategies[N]
will show my allegiance, without a doubt.[A]
[MidRight]
You'd better hope so. If I hear of any[N]
treachery, I won't allow it to fester.[N]
We're in too weak a state for mercy,[AN]
and those two kids have suffered enough.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
As you should, Captain.[N]
I respect your dedication.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]That's all I wanted[N]
to say. I'll be off.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace][Event]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
It is a welcome boon that those two have[N]
an experienced guardian like her. Alone,[N]
the rebels may be embers, but together,[AN]
even sparks can form an inferno. We can[N]
only hope Cythes fails to suppress it[Beat][A][X]


## Ch5xKwameSceneMiraDead
[MidLeft][LoadKwame][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I intended to discuss our future[N]
strategic plans, but interrupting[N]
them would be callous indeed.[AN]
They have lost much, and I doubt[N]
they desire the sympathy of an[N]
outsider like myself. Still,[AN]
the bonds between these Liberators[N]
are heartening. Alone, the rebels[N]
may be embers, but together,[AN]
even sparks can form an inferno.[N]
I can only hope Cythes fails[N]
to douse this growing flame[Beat][A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting1
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][LoadKwame]
[Right]
Well, here we are. Elmhurst Island isn't[N]
much, but it helps us keep a low profile.[A]
[MidLeft]
Yes, I imagine all the vegetation[N]
here serves as a welcome cover.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Right. We know the paths well enough[N]
and have traps set all over the island.[N]
Even if occupation forces found us,[AN]
they would perish before escaping.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Well, a large part of that is Trajan[Beat][N]
That guy's a monster and a half.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Trajan?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
The man on the shore there. For now,[N]
let us hurry and dock the boat. The[N]
reserve unit will come and take it,[AN]
and after that, we will use a land[N]
route to reach our base of operations.[A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting2
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
Loewe, Cleo! I'm glad to see the two of[N]
you made it out alive. Where's Dragana?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Trajan, she[Beat] was imprisoned by Cidor.[N]
We almost made it out, but Cidor[N]
struck her down at the last second.[A]
[MidLeft]
Really? Just like that, huh[Beat] After[N]
all she survived, this is how it all ends?[N]
That dastard[Beat] he'll pay for this.[A]
[FarRight]
Our rescue mission failed, so any[N]
consequence of that lies on our[N]
shoulders. I will accept the blame-[A]
[MidLeft]
There's no point in that. We just have[N]
to look forward and continue her legacy.[N]
[Beat]Still, what happened out there?[AN]
Last I heard, the main unit planned to[N]
attack a supply line connecting[N]
Selese and General Elias's forces.[A]
[FarRight]
Boro left our group in favor of Cidor,[N]
leaving a leadership vacuum in his wake.[N]
Then, we were ambushed by Selese forces,[AN]
which only a few of us escaped.[A]
[MidLeft]
We lost our leader, and even Boro[N]
abandoned us[Beat] One founder dead,[N]
and the other a traitor. Good grief[Beat][A]
[Right]
Well, not quite. He helped us get out[N]
of Cidor's manse by cutting down Selese[N]
troops that cornered us. Honestly,[AN]
I'm not sure what side he's on now,[N]
or if he's even alive anymore.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Hm[Beat] And Mira?[A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting3MiraAlive
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
[MidRight][LoadMira]
I'm here, Trajan. Someone has to[N]
watch out for these two, after all.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Well, that's a relief. If I were[N]
the only founder left of the four,[N]
that'd be quite a burden to carry.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Don't worry, I won't die. Not until[N]
we've freed Decia, with our own hands.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I'm counting on that, Mira.[A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting3MiraDead
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
She[Beat] perished in the rescue[N]
attempt. We erred in our tactics.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Even Mira has fallen? That means I'm[N]
the last of the four founders left[Beat][N]
It seems your mission failed completely.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]I can't argue that point.[N]
If I had just reacted a second[N]
sooner, then maybe[Beat] Mira[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
No, I apologize. That you two lived[N]
is a miracle itself. I shouldn't have[N]
expected anything more from you.[A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting3MiraCaptured
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
She[Beat] was captured in the rescue[N]

That means I'm the last of the[N]
four founders who can fight[Beat][N]
It seems the mission didn't go well.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I can't argue that point.[N]
We lost one of our best fighters.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
No, at the very least, she may still[N]
be alive. We'll just have to rescue[N]
her at the earliest opportunity.[A]

Regardless, who is[N]
this man you're with?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, my apologies for not introducing[N]
myself. I am Kwame, a strategist who[N]
seeks to halt the Cythean advance.[AN]
For that purpose, I paid for this[N]
vessel, and its crew have decided to[N]
work with us after a Selesian attack.[A]
[Left]
You have my gratitude, then. Had you[N]
not intervened, I'm not sure when[N]
these two would have made it back.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
I will accept it with honor. Loewe spoke[N]
quite highly of you before our approach.[A]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
Ha, did he now? Come to think of it,[N]
it's about time for our monthly spar.[A][ToggleSmile]
[Right]
[Beat]Sorry, Trajan, but we don't have[N]
time for that. Kwame can fill you in.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Alright, we'll postpone it til later.[N]
You two, take the boat around the back![N]
I'll lead the way back to headquarters.[A][X]

Our spar can wait til I get back.[A]
[MidLeft]
Fair enough. Loewe, Cleo, I've got one[N]
piece of advice for you before[N]
you head out. Care to hear it?[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Of course, Commander Trajan.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
If these divine weapons are all they're[N]
cracked up to be, then Kwame's not wrong[N]
that they're important. However,[AN]
wars are won with strategy and manpower.[N]
No matter what kind of secret[N]
weapons we have to deal with,[AN]
our path to victory remains the same.[N]
Fight like hell, and come back alive.[A]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
You don't have to tell me twice![N]
I'll take out enough Cytheans for[N]
the both of us, Trajan. Count on it.[A]
[MidLeft]
I'll hold you to it. Now, better get[N]
a move on! Give the heir my apologies[N]
for not being able to be there myself.[A][ToggleSmile]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]

## Ch5xEliasIntroduction
[MidRight][LoadElias][ThreeLineBox]
Phew[Beat] quite the trek from Decia,[N]
but I finally made it. I never thought[N]
the emperor would call me to Gechrysos,[AN]
not when Decia is unstable. "Meet in the[N]
courtyard," eh? It's times like these[N]
that I'm glad you're with me, Nerube![A]
[FarFarRight][OneLineBox]
Graaa[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Oh, don't gripe. Taking the back way[N]
already saved us some time. You'll[N]

Halt! Who's[Beat] Sir Elias?![N]
What are you doing here?[A]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Sorry, but that's on a need-to-know[N]
basis. I'm afraid that's all I can say.[A][ToggleSmile]
[MidLeft]
No, I mean "here." We expected[N]
you'd be at the palace's entrance.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, that? Uh[Beat] Well, I would have[N]
had to leave Nerube behind, right?[N]
He wouldn't fit inside the hallways.[A]
[MidLeft]
Please tell us in the future[N]
before doing this again, sir.[N]
For security reasons, we must-[A]

## Ch5xLeonidasIntroduction

[MidRight][LoadElias]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Honestly[Beat] I don't remember raising[N]
you to fly into the emperor's palace.[N]
You couldn't just take the front door?[A]
[MidRight]
I didn't want to waste any of His[N]
Majesty's time, Father. Well, if you're[N]
here, then he called for you as well?[A]
[MidLeft]
Indeed. None of the other knights are[N]
here, however. They all have duties[N]
in other territories, as you'd expect.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
So do I, but here I am.[N]
Is Emperor Orfeas late?[A]
[MidLeft]
It seems so[Beat] Tell me, Elias.[N]
Have you heard any news of Cleo?[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]No, not yet. I sent Varga to search[N]
for her, but I've heard no word since.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I see. I thought that being stationed[N]
in Decia, under your watch, may help[N]
her acclimate to military life[Beat][AN]
but Decia is too dangerous, no matter[N]
her talent. I failed her as a father.[A]
[MidRight]
Don't give up hope. Cleo's tougher than[N]
you think, so I know she wouldn't die[N]
just like that. Isn't that right?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Yes, of course. That I need to be[N]
consoled by my own son is a bit[N]
disgraceful, but still, thank you.[A]
[MidRight]
I'll find her, you can count on it[Beat][N]
Anyway, where is the emperor?[N]
Did he get lost in Mahemen?[A]

I meant no offense, Your Majesty![A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Ha, there is no need to kneel.[N]
As you say, I am quite late.[A]
[FarRight]
My emperor, we've arrived as you[N]
requested[Beat] Who might this be?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, this is Coralia, my granddaughter.[N]
Of my possible successors, she holds[N]
the most promise, so from time to time,[AN]
she shadows my meetings for experience.[A]
[FarLeft]
It is a pleasure to meet the both of[N]
you. I have heard much about your[N]
exploits in Decia, Sir Elias. Or[Beat][AN]
Should I call you the Vermillion Knight?[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Just Elias is fine, my lady. Our knightly[N]
titles are a bit embarrassing, to be frank.[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Very well, Elias. And of course, my[N]
grandfather has spoken often of the[N]
Auric Lion, guardian of Cythes.[AN]
You have my greatest respect.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
I appreciate it, but I only do my[N]
duty in Orfeas's name. Nothing more.[A]
[Right]
So, uh[Beat] What did you want[N]
to tell me, Your Majesty?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, yes. I received a letter from Duke[N]
Cidor of Selese, requesting aid from[N]
Cythes in dealing with a few rebels.[AN]
They have evaded his grasp and caused[N]
him no end of problems, as he says it.[N]
What do you make of the situation?[A]
[Right]
The Decian Liberators are a resourceful[N]
group. That he struggles to end their[N]
threat, once and for all, is of no surprise.[A]
[Left]
Hmm[Beat] Why did he not send the letter to[N]
you, instead? You oversee the occupation,[N]
so surely a direct request was unnecessary.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]Well, I've met him before, and our[N]
acquaintance isn't a cordial one.[N]
Even if he is nominally on our side,[AN]
I've no respect for traitors. Perhaps[N]
he felt uncomfortable asking me himself.[A]
[Left]
Traitor he may be, but his cooperation[N]
with us greatly reduced the bloodshed[N]
necessary to cow Decia into submission.[AN]
His defeat would form a vacuum in the[N]
region that rebels could easily fill,[N]
rallying other citizens to their cause.[AN]
That cannot be allowed. Elias, send[N]
as many troops as Cidor requires.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
[Beat]As you wish. Is that all, then?[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
Indeed. Perhaps this did not require a[N]
personal meeting, but I wanted to see how[N]
you have progressed since your induction.[AN]
Today, I see before me a fine knight,[N]
worthy of his accolades and place as[N]
youngest member of the Order of Iris.[A]
[Right]
I am humbled by your praise,[N]
my emperor, and I can only[N]
hope to live up to it.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
I trust that you will. Now, I must[N]
attend another meeting. Coralia,[N]
you may return to your studies.[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Yes, Grandfather.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]

Sorry for the lie, too. I can't tell[N]

If you dislike my grandfather's actions,[N]
then why are you executing his will?[A]

No matter my feelings, it doesn't[N]
change what we have to do. In order[N]
to avert the coming catastrophe,[AN]
his plans must succeed. That's all.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
W-What? I don't understand[Beat] Why tell[N]
