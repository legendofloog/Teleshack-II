Mm, this must be the place. I see[N]
our escorts just across the shore...[N]
I'd best inform the others.[AN][X]

## Ch5xKwameGoesDown2
[MidLeft][LoadKwame]
Loewe! Cleo! We've[N]
arrived at the island![A][X]

## Ch5xLoeweCleoTalk
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
[MidRight][LoadCleo][ThreeLineBox]
Loewe, we'll arrive at the base in[N]
an hour. We should prepare ourselves.[N]
[Beat]You seem out of it. What is it?[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I was just thinking about the past.[N]
We've worked together for a couple years[N]
now, but it feels like I met you ages ago.[A]
[MidRight]
It does, doesn't it? Even so, I remember[N]
well the day I defected. You and Dragana[N]
alone welcomed me, among the rebels,[AN]
so I have much to thank you two for.[A]
[MidLeft]
Honestly, I didn't know what to think[N]
at first, either. A highborn woman walks[N]
in and wants to join a rebellion[Beat][AN]
Sounds like the setup to a bad joke.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
H-Highborn?[.4] To be clear,[N]
I am not a noble of any kind.[A]
[MidLeft]
Even so, you're no commoner either.[N]
I admit I'm curious about your past[Beat][AN]
but no matter what, you're my ally[N]
and a friend, and that's what counts.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Loewe[Beat] When our work is done,[N]
I can tell you what you wish to know.[N]
However, I do have one condition.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Oh, what's that?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox][ToggleSmile]
I have my own questions for you.[N]
If you'll answer them, then I will[N]
return the favor. Is that acceptable?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Well, there's not much to say[Beat][N]
but alright. I'll take you up on that.[A]
[MidRight]
Excellent. For now, we must both[N]
survive until that day comes.[A][X]


## Ch5xKwameSceneMiraAlive1
[MidLeft][LoadKwame][OneLineBox]
Well, another time, then[Beat][A][X]

## Ch5xKwameSceneMiraAlive2
[MidLeft][LoadKwame]
[MidRight][LoadMira]
Hold a moment, Kwame.[N]
Why were you watching them?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I intended to discuss the Liberators'[N]
coming plans with our commanders,[N]
but they seemed preoccupied.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Not a bad excuse for what looked like[N]
spying, but it won't work on me.[AN]
I know it when I see it, because I spied[N]
often myself as House Selese's spymaster,[N]
before Cidor bent the knee to Cythes.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
You quit twelve years ago, then.[N]
Did you join the rebellion immediately?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Aye. I heard that two knights of House[N]
Freyse planned to organize a rebellion,[N]
and with that, my path was set.[A]
[MidLeft]
One of those being General Dragana[Beat][N]
Her loss must be keenly felt among you.[N]
My condolences, Captain Mira.[A]
[MidRight]
Hmph[Beat] kind words won't gain you favor.[N]
You know nothing of our struggles, and[N]
we can't trust a complete stranger.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]A fair point. Then I'll have to[N]
allow my strategies to show my loyalty.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Better hope they do. If I see any hint[N]
of treachery, I'll root it out without[N]
remorse. Mercy is a luxury we don't have.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
As you should, Captain.[N]
I respect your dedication.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Not easily intimidated, eh?[N]
That's all I wanted to say.[N]
so I'll be on my way.[A][X]

## Ch5xKwameSceneMiraAlive3
[MidLeft][LoadKwame]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]It is fortunate that those two have a[N]
watchful, if abrasive, guardian. I'm sure[N]
they'll rely on her in the days to come.[AN]
The rebels may be only embers, but united,[N]
even sparks can form an inferno. Let us[N]
hope this growing flame is not doused[Beat][A][X]


## Ch5xKwameSceneMiraDead
[MidLeft][LoadKwame][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I intended to discuss our future[N]
strategic plans, but interrupting[N]
them would be callous indeed.[AN]
I doubt they desire the sympathy of[N]
an outsider like myself. Still,[N]
the Liberators' bonds are heartening.[AN]
The rebels may be only embers, but united,[N]
even sparks can form an inferno. Let us[N]
hope this growing flame is not doused[Beat][A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting1
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][LoadKwame]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
It's good to be back. Elmhurst Island[N]
isn't much, but it keeps us out of[N]
Cythes's reach, so it's good enough.[A]
[FarRight]
Right. We know the paths well enough[N]
and have traps set all over the island.[N]
Even if occupation forces found us,[AN]
they would perish before escaping.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Well, a large part of that is Trajan[Beat][N]
That guy's a monster and a half.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Trajan?[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
The man on the shore there. For now,[N]
let us hurry and dock the boat. The[N]
reserve unit is waiting for us.[A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting2
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
Loewe, Cleo! I'm glad to see the two of[N]
you made it out alive. Where's Dragana?[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Trajan, she[Beat] was imprisoned by Cidor.[N]
We almost made it out, but Cidor[N]
struck her down at the last second.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Really? Just like that, huh[Beat][N]
That dastard[Beat] He'll pay for this.[A]
[FarRight][ThreeLineBox]
Our rescue mission failed, so the[N]
consequences lie on our shoulders.[N]
I will accept the blame-[A]
[MidLeft]
There's no point in assigning fault now.[N]
We just have to continue her legacy.[N]
[Beat]Still, what happened out there?[AN]
Last I heard, the main unit planned to[N]
attack a supply line connecting[N]
Selese and General Elias's forces.[A]
[FarRight]
Boro left our group in favor of Cidor,[N]
leaving a leadership vacuum in his wake.[N]
Then, we were ambushed by Selese forces.[A]
[MidLeft]
So we lost our leader, and even Boro[N]
abandoned us[Beat] One founder dead,[N]
and the other a traitor. Good grief[Beat][A]
[Right]
Boro also helped us escape the jails.[N]
Honestly, I'm not sure what side[N]
he's on now, or if he's even alive.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Hm[Beat] And Mira?[A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting3MiraAlive
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
[MidRight][LoadMira]
Did you think I was gone? Don't worry,[N]
I won't die. Not until Decia is free.[A]
[MidLeft]
Well, that's a relief. If I were[N]
the only founder left of the four,[AN]
that'd be quite a burden to carry.[N]
I'm glad that you made it back, Mira.[A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting3MiraDead
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
She[Beat] perished in the rescue[N]
attempt. We erred in our tactics.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Even Mira has fallen? That means I'm[N]
the last of the four founders left[Beat][N]
It seems your mission failed completely.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]I can't argue that point.[N]
If I had just reacted a second[N]
sooner, then maybe[Beat] Mira[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
No, I apologize. That you two lived[N]
is a miracle itself. I shouldn't have[N]
expected anything more from you.[A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting3MiraCaptured
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
She[Beat] was captured in the rescue[N]
attempt. We erred in our tactics.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That means I'm the last of the[N]
four founders who can fight[Beat][N]
It seems the mission didn't go well.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I can't argue that point.[N]
We lost one of our best fighters.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
No, at the very least, she may still[N]
be alive. We'll just have to rescue[N]
her at the earliest opportunity.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Right. That's all we can do now[Beat][A][X]


## Ch5xTrajanMeeting4
[FarLeft][LoadKwame]
[Left][LoadTrajan]
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[Left][OneLineBox]
And who is this man you're with?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, my apologies. I am Kwame, a[N]
strategist who seeks to halt the[N]
Cythean advance. For that purpose,[AN]
I paid for this vessel, and its[N]
crew have decided to work with[N]
us after a Selesian attack.[A]
[Left]
You have my gratitude, then. Had you[N]
not intervened, I'm not sure when[N]
these two would have made it back.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
I will accept it with honor. Loewe spoke[N]
quite highly of you before our approach.[A]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
Ha, did he now? Glad to hear it. Care[N]
to see how great I am firsthand, Loewe?[A][ToggleSmile]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Sorry, Trajan, but we don't have[N]
time for a spar. Kwame can fill you in,[N]
but we gathered a lot of new information.[A]
[Left]
Alright, we'll postpone it til later.[N]
You two, take the boat around the back![N]
I'll lead the way back to headquarters.[A][X]

## Ch5xTrajanMeeting5
[MidLeft][LoadTrajan]
Hmm[Beat] Best we use the war room for[N]
any important planning. Follow me![A][X]


## Ch5xStrategyRoom
[FarLeft][LoadTrajan]
[Left][LoadLoewe]
[Right][LoadCleo]
[FarRight][LoadKwame]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I see. It looks like the Cythean offense[N]
is more dire than I thought. What do[N]
you three think our next move should be?[A]
[Left]
The obvious target is Selese.[N]
Their location provides the[N]
Cytheans with a foothold in Decia.[AN]
If we take that position ourselves,[N]
we'll gain more recruits out of Selese's[N]
citizens and rid ourselves of Cidor.[A]
[Right]
After our escape, I am certain Cidor will[N]
ask for aid. If General Elias intervenes,[N]
we have no chance of claiming victory.[A]
[Left][OneLineBox]
Well then, what's your suggestion?[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
Seeking out Mahemen could give us[N]
more information about the weapons,[AN]
and informing Chouwouj of the emperor's[N]
ambitions may yield new allies.[A]
[Left][ThreeLineBox]
We can't rely on the promises of[N]
Chouwouj's warlords without their king,[N]
and we can't afford to sail west now.[AN]
The journey to Mahemen is long, and[N]
its deserts arduous. Being gone too long[N]
will risk losing even more Decian land.[A]
[FarRight]
An astute point, but with all plans[N]
comes risks, and a direct assault on[N]
Cidor's territory is riskiest of all.[AN]
Cleo's point about Chouwouj holds[N]
true, however. There are many who[N]
could potentially side with us,[AN]
and there are even whispers that[N]
a member of the royal family survived.[A]
[Left]
Acting based off rumors seems[N]
unwise[Beat] Any ideas, Trajan?[N]
We seem to be at an impasse.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Yes, well[Beat] You spoke of[N]
the axe of Decia, correct?[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Indeed. What of it?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I was a knight of House Freyse once.[N]
There's an old tale of an ancient[N]
axe stored beneath the ground,[AN]
passed down from lord to heir.[N]
It's possible that is what you seek.[A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
If so, why would the former lord[N]
not have used it against Cythes?[A]
[FarLeft][ThreeLineBox]
His forces were outnumbered ten to one.[N]
No weapon could bridge that gulf,[N]
even if he could have unearthed it.[A]
[Left]
I hadn't thought of it, but Freyse was[N]
the highest Decian house before the fall.[N]
A connection to the axe seems plausible.[A]
[FarLeft]
There's one more important detail.[N]
Last week, I received a report[N]
on rebel activity in Freyse.[AN]
It appears that Joakim's heir survived,[N]
and he marches with a well-worn army.[A]
[Right]
Then it seems our course is clear.[N]
If we leave this heir to their[N]
own devices, they may perish.[A]
[FarRight]
Very true. Even if we cannot find the[N]
axe, House Freyse has many followers[N]
even now that may fight for our cause.[A]
[Left]
It's settled, then. We'll sail back[N]
east and make our way to Freyse.[N]
Trajan, will you come with us?[A]
[FarLeft]
Unfortunately, I have to protect the[N]
base. That being said, I can lend you[N]
[Red]two[Red] members of our reserve corps.[AN]
I'm sure that they'll prove useful.[A]
[Right]
Thank you. Loewe, we should go survey[N]
the potential recruits. Kwame, do you[N]
mind waiting for us to choose?[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
Not at all. Please choose wisely.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
Talk to me when you're done,[N]
and I'll get the boat ready.[A]
[Right]
My thanks. Now, let us see these[N]
volunteers for ourselves[Beat][A][X]

She looks to carry a lance, which we[N]
don't have many users of. In addition,[N]
her pegasus can fly. If one of us is[Beat][AN]
unable to help, she could fight[N]
in the skies in our stead,[N]

Varga[Beat] I'm glad you survived[N]

[MidLeft]
We have much to talk about,[N]
but not in front of him.[A]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I'm sorry, Loewe. Could you step[N]
away for a moment? Varga is[Beat][N]
friend of mine from Cythes.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
Very well. I'm trusting your judgment,[N]
Cleo. Talk to me when you're done.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[Right][ThreeLineBox]
Well, now that he's gone, you need[N]
hold nothing back. Why were you[N]
masquerading as a Selesian guard?[A]
[MidLeft]
Your brother asked me to investigate[N]
your disappearance, as he believed that[N]
the story of your death was unlikely.[A]
[Right]
Well, I suppose that's reason enough[N]
to look for me, but again, why were[N]
you there during our mission?[A]
[MidLeft]
I heard of Dragana's capture and a[N]
rebel strategist that used Cythean[N]
maneuvers, so I connected the dots.[AN]
Besides, your defection is unsurprising.[N]
Loyalty to family kept you to your duties,[N]
but everyone has a breaking point.[A]
[Right]
Can you blame me? This occupation is[N]
unjust! Emperor Orfeas commands[N]
that we take over the continent,[AN]
and anyone who challenges us[N]
is lucky to keep their lives,[N]
let alone their homes or food.[AN]
I cannot begin to fathom his motives,[N]
save that they are morally bankrupt.[A]
[MidLeft]
Then what of your brother? He leads this[N]
[OpenQuote]unjust" occupation and answers to the[N]
emperor. What do you think drives him?[A]
[Right]
[Beat]I do not know. Growing up, I thought[N]
that Elias knew everything, and if I only[N]
followed the path he laid out for me,[AN]
I too could be of service to my country.[N]
Now, I can scarcely stomach the notion,[N]
but what does he see that I cannot?[A]
[MidLeft]
There is always more than meets the[N]
eye, my student. The people do not[N]
follow Orfeas due to power alone.[AN]
Everyone is ruled by something higher[N]
than a single man. Fear, greed, hope[Beat][N]
These ideals are what they see, Cleo.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]I have much to contemplate,[N]
but now that you have found me,[N]
what do you intend to tell Elias?[A]
[MidLeft]
That you are alive and number among[N]
the rebels. I already sent a letter[N]
while we were in Port Neufchatel.[A]
[Right][OneLineBox]
And what now? Will you return to Cythes?[A]

[Right][ThreeLineBox]
No, not particularly. Cleo, you mind if[N]
I talk to this guy alone? I've got some[N]
questions that I want him to answer.[A]

I have no issue with that. Looking[N]

Little lion? What does that mean?[N]
And for the record, you're the last[N]

Ah, my apologies. I once knew a woman[N]
of Mahemen who reminds me of you, with[N]
bladework sharper than a lion's fang.[A]

[Beat]You spent time in Mahemen, then.[N]
Do you recognize this sword? It belonged[N]
to my mother before Cythes invaded.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]It is difficult to believe that any[N]
commoner could have such a blade.[N]
Who exactly were your parents, Loewe?[A]
[Right]
My father studied Mahemeni history, but[N]
my mother didn't speak much of her past.[N]
Her peerless swordplay spoke for itself.[A]
[MidLeft]
A scholar, eh? I suppose that is how[N]
you knew of the Book of Havarti.[N]
And what is your mother's name?[A]

That blade doesn't appear to be one of[N]

it does have some kind of enchantment.[AN]

Before today, we knew nothing[N]

Lord Joakim was cautious, indeed.[A]

Whatever they're like, I just hope we[N]

True enough. Well, either way, I'll[N]

You could've just asked me, Iskra.[N]
I know how to use a sword just as well.[A]

Sure, but Loewe's sword style is different[N]
from any Decian discipline. It'd be useful[N]
to have more than one user of it, right?[A]
