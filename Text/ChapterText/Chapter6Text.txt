Put [Red]3[Red] units in the green squares[N]
to enter or exit the arena. Once they[N]
leave, the arena will close its doors,[N]
disallowing any future participation.[AN]
Your units will be healed after every[N]
victory in the arena, and on the next[N]
turn, a new round of enemies will arrive.[AN]
If the red line is crossed, Barod will[N]
get very angry, resulting in a [Red]Game Over[Red].[A][X]

Yuria Islands[X]

## Ch6LongMonologueIntro
Yuria Islands, known as the[N]
crown jewel of the Decian Sea.[N]
The floating city was constructed[N]
thousands of years ago by the hands[N]
of a young couple, Alf and Eitha.[AN]
A booming trade center at its[N]
time, the city amassed incredible[N]
wealth surpassing that of even[N]
the Decian royal family.[AN]
With their newfound wealth, they built[N]
the tower of guidance, as a symbol[N]
of gratitude to the supposed[N]
goddess of merchants and wealth.[AN]
Their faith bore fruit, as a branch of[N]
the tree of life was bestowed upon them.[N]
Alf and Eitha used their gift to create[N]
two enchanted items, a bow and a staff.[AN]
The bow is known today as the renowned[N]
divine weapon Daybreaker. The staff,[N]
the Azurium Scepter, sank with the[N]
tower, its master, and the master's[N]
followers into the depths...[A][X]

You know damn well I won't[N]

McCallum[Beat] He took everything[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I know you and that pirate[N]
have a history[Beat][AN]
But you're going to get[N]
yourself killed, Cromar![AN]
I'd be[Beat] all alone again[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
That's why it'll be him who dies[N]
this time. He killed my sister, Leina.[AN]
I can't just forget that.[N]
Don't follow me.[AN][X]

I have what you asked.[N]
Had to clear the arena for it,[N]

[MidLeft]
McCallum![N]
Today, you answer for your crimes.[AN]
[MidRight]
Eh? What's your deal, lad?[N]
I'm in the middle of something.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
This isn't the same ship[Beat][N]
A murderer[Beat] and a thief.[N]
Taker of lives, taker of ships.[AN]
It's up to me to dispense justice.[N]
For you, McCallum, killed my sister,[N]
and took her away from this world![AN]
I've given it all up just for[N]
this one moment[Beat][AN]
McCallum[Beat] prepare to die![AN]
[MidRight]
Quite a speech, lad. But I don't[N]
know what you're on about.[N]
I won't deny I've had a rough history.[AN]
In just this life, I've done much.[N]
Kill. Pillage. Loot. Steal.[AN]
Throw eggs at kids.[N]
Throw elders out of windows.[N]
You name the crime, I've done it.[AN]
I won't bore you with my upbringing.[N]
My horrid father, my drunken mother[Beat][AN]
But I'll be damned if I continue[N]
to let the past define me.[AN]
This boat[Beat] I thought it could[N]
be my chance to escape.[N]
Start a new life, leave McCallum behind.[AN]
Become a new man.[N]
Be the man I needed as a youth.[N]
Call myself something new[Beat][AN]
Something regal, like Bartolomeu[Beat][N]
But alas[Beat] I can't outrun it.[N]
Alright then. Cromar, you said?[AN]
Come at me, lad![N]
Today is my last day as McCallum,[N]
the Dread Pirate![AN]
Fear the axe that has cleaved[N]
countless who dared challenge me![A][X]

## Ch6BarodIntro
[MidRight][LoadBarod][ThreeLineBox]
Hm, the Decian Liberators are here?[N]
Perhaps you'd be interested in my[N]
arena challenge.[AN]
Defeat the gauntlet and claim[N]
a prize. A feat of strength, endurance,[N]
wit, and cunning![AN]
Remember[Beat] This is a deathmatch.[N]
If you fail to best your opponent[Beat][N]
Don't expect me to save you.[A][X]

## Ch6BarodIntro1

Our favorite local lads.[N]
The hometown heroes.[N]

## Ch6BarodIntro3

From the barren desert of[N]

Dropouts of the great[N]
magic academy of Cythes.[N]

## Ch6CleoLoeweIntro
[MidLeft][LoadCleo][MidRight][LoadLoewe][TwoLineBox]
[MidLeft]
I don't like us spending too much time[N]
here, Loewe.[AN]
We left the boat unguarded.[N]
This place is crawling with rogues.[AN]
[MidRight]
Lighten up, Cleo.[N]
Things are looking up for us.[AN]
We've fortified our strength.[N]
We're going to make our march.[AN]
This is our last chance to stock[N]
up in neutral territory.[AN]
I can't blame everyone for wanting[N]
to take it easy, maybe go to the arena.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Absolutely not.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Hey[Beat] Wait, what's that by our boat?[N]
There are people fighting!?[AN]
[MidLeft]
This is why we don't leave the[N]
boat unguarded, Loewe.[AN]
Now we are going to make a scene.[N]
You realize this is a problem, don't you?[AN]
[MidRight]
Must you chide me now?[N]
Come on, let's get it back.[A][X]

## Ch6PirateIntro

Wahaha! Look at me lads,[N]
I'm the captain now![N]
It's time to celebrate.[AN]
This town will learn to fear[N]
the name of Cap'n Draken.[N]
Tear it up, lads![AN]
That dead dastard Alf[N]
with his damned scepter[Beat][N]
Who is he anyway?[AN]
Behold! I now hold the power of[N]
the azurium scepter.[N]
I will shape this island in my name![AN]
The waves cannot shake us,[N]
for we can walk on water as[N]
though it were solid ground![AN]
With McCallum leaving us behind[N]
it's up to us to take the mantle.[N]
Today, my friends, we charge![AN]
Shuck their shells like clams![N]

[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I don't like this.[N]
This is getting chaotic.[AN]
The Yuria Islands don't have[N]
any formal military.[AN]
Pirates could basically run[N]
the place if they wanted.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Loewe, we can't solve their problems.[N]
We shouldn't have stopped here.[AN]
Let's remedy that by getting our[N]
boat back and disembarking. Now.[AN]
[MidRight]
You'd so soon leave innocents to[N]
the slaughter, Cleo?[AN]

Who are you supposed to be?[AN]

I'm Leina, formerly a maiden of[N]
Chouwouj, now traveling the world.[AN]
[FarRight]
Forgive our caution, but what[N]
business do you have with us?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm sympathetic to your cause.[N]
Chouwouj has suffered at the[AN]
hands of Cytheans for years.[AN]
[Right]
Right[Beat] And?[AN]
Why would a noble lady like you[N]
associate with rebels like us?[AN]
[MidLeft]
If you must know, my lover is dueling[N]
to the death with some[Beat] pirate.[AN]
He is blinded by rage,[N]
so I must rescue him.[AN]
With or without your help.[AN]

My sister's ring[Beat][N]
How did you find it?[AN]

I received it after defeating[N]

she stole it from a female classmate.[AN]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Folks from all over Orodreth come to[N]
these islands to try their hand at the arena.[N]
It is a well-loved bloodsport to many.[AN]
This blade, the killing edge,[N]
is a popular choice among sword-wielders[N]
who dare to test their mettle.[AN]
You look pretty tough. I bet you'd[N]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I never recommend leaving your home[N]
without some way to heal yourself.[N]
Why? The world is dangerous![AN]
Pirates are everywhere, at least around[N]
here, and that blasted arena attracts[N]
only the most unsavory of sorts![AN]
Why haven't I left yet, you ask?[N]
Frankly, the weather is fantastic.[N]
My joints have never felt better.[AN]
But that's enough about me.[N]

You can always tell when he's[N]

Every time he dares to draw his blade[N]
an awful fog rolls in. It's terrible![N]
But, as quick as it arrives,[AN]
the moment he sheathes his mighty sword[N]
the fog begins to disappear.[N]
A strange man, shrouded in darkness, he is.[AN]
My nephew, hearing my complaints,[N]
bought me this tome some time ago.[N]
While you'd think it would cut through fog,[AN]
it has no such effect, sadly.[N]
It is a poorly named tome, if you ask me.[N]

For all we know it's held in the hands[N]
