## Ch6LongMonologueIntro
Yuria Islands,[N]
the crown jewel of the Decian Sea.[AN]
The floating city was constructed[N]
200 years ago, under the hands of[AN]
a young couple, Alf and Eitha.[AN]
A booming trade center at its[N]
time, the city amassed incredible[AN]
wealth. Surpassing that of even the[N]
Decian royal family.[AN]
With their new found wealth, they built[N]
the tower of guidance, as a symbol[AN]
of gratitude to the supposed goddess[N]
of merchants and wealth.[AN]
Their faith bore fruit, a branch of[N]
the tree of life was bestowed upon them.[AN]
A bow and a staff was made out of this.[N]
The bow is known today as the renowned[AN]
divine weapon Daybreaker. The staff,[N]
the Azurium Scepter, sank with the[AN]
tower, its master, and its follower,[N]
into the depth.[A][X]

the Azurium Scepter.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Azurium, one of the[N]
divine elements?[AN]
The one that turns people[N]
into fish? Ugh.[AN]
[MidRight]
It's more of a divinely[N]
guided aquatic lifestyle.[AN]
If we find some Azurium,[N]
we can turn one of us[AN]
into an aquatic fighter.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ugh, no thanks.[A][X]

Who are you supposed to be?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm Leina, formerly a maiden of[N]
Chouwouj, now traveling the world.[AN]
[FarRight]
Forgive our caution but what[N]
business do you have with us?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I'm sympathetic to your cause.[N]
Chouwouj has suffered a the hands[AN]
of Cythean for years.[AN]
[Right]
Right[Beat] And?[AN]
Why would a noble lady like you[N]
associate with rebels like us?[AN]
[MidLeft]
If you must know, my lover is dueling[N]
to the death with some[Beat] pirate.[AN]
He is blinded by rage[N]
so I must rescue him.[AN]
with or without your help.[AN]
[FarRight]
We are fighting the pirates,[N]
so any help we can get, right?[AN]
[Right]
Sure, just don't die, alright?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh and by the way, if you find[N]
a fancy bow, it's probably my[AN]
family heirloom. It's not[N]
expensive and definitely not a[AN]
legendary weapon or anything.[AN]
[Right]
Yeah, right.[N]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Folks from all over Orodreth come to[N]
these islands to try their hand at the arena.[N]
It is a well-loved bloodsport to many.[AN]
This blade, the killing edge,[N]
is a popular choice among sword-wielders[N]
who dare to test their mettle.[AN]
You look pretty tough. I bet you'd[N]
make good use out of it.[N]
Go on. Take the blade![A][X]

## Ch6Village2

[MidLeft][LoadMan1]
[MidRight][LoadActive]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I never recommend leaving your home[N]
without some way to heal yourself.[N]
Why? The world is dangerous![AN]
Pirates are everywhere, at least around[N]
here, and that blasted arena attracts[N]
only the most unsavory of sorts![AN]
Why haven't I left yet, you ask?[N]
Frankly, the weather is fantastic.[N]
My joints have never felt better.[AN]
But that's enough about me.[N]
I ain't got much else to say.[N]
If you don't have any healing, this will help.[A][X]

That Cromar[Beat][N]
You can always tell when he's[N]
fighting, the mad man.[AN]
Every time he dares to draw his blade[N]
an awful fog rolls in. It's terrible![N]
But, as quick as it arrives,[AN]
the moment he sheathes his mighty sword[N]
the fog begins to disappear.[N]
A strange man, shrouded in darkness, he is.[AN]
My nephew, hearing my complaints,[N]
bought me this tome some time ago.[N]
While you'd think it would cut through fog,[AN]
it has no such effect, sadly.[N]
It is a poorly named tome, if you ask me.[N]
I got no use for it, you can have it.[A][X]

The islands here are rumored to house[N]
massive wealth. Unthinkable, to many.[N]
Yet still, there are pirates.[A]
[FarLeft][TwoLineBox]
The existence of wealth does not mean[N]
coin crosses the palm of all equally.[AN]
For all we know it's held in the hands[N]
of the few, while others resort to piratry.[AN]
Given the state of things, it wouldn't[N]
surprise me if many here fell on hard times.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Hard times[Beat] indeed.[A]
