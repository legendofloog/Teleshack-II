[MidLeft]
I will ask you one more time.[N]
We need those supplies.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
What gives you the right?[N]
Our village needs this[N]
harvest for the winter.[A]
[MidLeft]
As citizens of Freyse, you should[N]
be honoured to provide for our[N]
cause to drive back the Empire![A]
[MidRight]
What have you damned nobles ever[N]
done for us beside take and take?[N]
Why must we care about your pride?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I tire of this. We will have those[N]
supplies, by force or otherwise.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You threaten us like common[N]
bandits. We will not concede our[N]
harvest to the likes of you![A]
[MidLeft]
If you will not give to the cause,[N]
then you are dogs of the Empire![AN]
Men! Forward! Crush these[N]
scum before Freyse's might![A][X]


## KorovaiEponyText
[MidRight][LoadEpony]
[MidLeft][LoadKorovai]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Oof! Putting my life on the[N]
line for a few bags of rice?[N]
Nothing has changed.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Lord Korovai, you must fall back![N]
You can't risk your life like this.[A]
[MidLeft]
I can defeat him![N]
Just give me-[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You're the heir of House[N]
Freyse now. You should do well[N]
to remember your status.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I'm sorry. What do[N]
you suggest we do?[A]
[MidRight]
The Empire's forces will[N]
be on us very soon.[AN]
It would be far too risky for us[N]
to take serious casualties here.[A]
[MidLeft]
Must we abandon this prize[N]
so close at hand?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Of course not. I have been[N]
in contact with some allies[N]
to bear that risk for us.[AN]
If they are not victorious[N]
before the Empire's[N]
reinforcements arrive,[AN]
then they will make for a[N]
nice distraction as we retreat.[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadIberis]
[Right][OneLineBox]
So Iber-[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
That's Lady Iberis to you, Decian.[N]
I expect the minimum from a commoner.[A]
[Right]
LADY Iberis, these are the[N]
enemies of the rebellion?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You heard me the first time.[N]
These traitorous turncoats have[N]
sold themselves to the Empire,[AN]
despite all House Freyse has[N]
done for them![AN]
Crushing these scum and securing[N]
their supplies would be an easy[N]
task for you.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
And you want us to do all this, just[N]
for an audience with Lord Korovai?[A]
[MidLeft]
We must be sure that you are[N]
worthy of assisting his lordship.[A]
[Right]
This is ridiculous, you've promised[N]
us nothing of substance for our help.[A]
[FarRight]
We've come all this way, Loewe.[N]
Every blow against the Empire counts.[A]
[Right]
Fine. I expect our demands[N]
to be met in return.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
That's not for me or you to decide.[A][X]

## MifanGiantText
[MidRight][LoadMifan]
[MidLeft][LoadTheGiant]
[MidRight]
Damn, there's more raiders coming![N]
Fate must be conspiring against us.[A]
[MidLeft]
Mi, I'll hold them off here.[N]
I'll buy us the time we need.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Against all of them?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You can trust me. Go deal with the rest[N]
of them, I'll make sure these dastards[N]
don't take a single step in our village.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
If you can't hold them off, just[N]
run! Don't force yourself.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
That won't happen.[A][X]


## WellworthMifanText
[MidRight][LoadMifan]
[MidLeft][LoadWellworth]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I hear the enemies at the gates![N]
They'll have to step over my[N]
corpse to get to our harvest![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Please just stay inside,[N]
leave the fighting to us.[A]
[MidLeft]
You need me out there.[N]
I'm not too old for battle![A]
[MidRight]
Grandpa, we got it under control.[N]
There's no need for you to fight.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Of course you do, you're the[N]
granddaughter of the Great Wellworth![N]
Give them hell for me![A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I will![A][X]

## AxelAlexIfAliveText
[MidRight][LoadAlex]
[MidLeft][LoadAxel]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That armoured fellow on a[N]
horse. I trust my eyes,[N]
is that who I think it is?[A]
[MidRight]
Damn. The similarities are uncanny,[N]
but that's the heir to House Freyse.[N]
It can't be.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
What if it is? I don't[N]
believe in coincidences.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
When we fled that botched heist,[N]
I thought he was dead for certain.[N]
But to reappear like this?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
It can't hurt for us to ask. The[N]
Jackal Gang doesn't give up its own.[A][X]

[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
You've done well. [A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
I hope that was enough of[N]
a "show of good faith."[A]
[Left]
Wasn't anything I couldn't have done.[N]
Regardless, a favour is a favour.[A]
[FarRight]
We were chasing up a lead[N]
on the Axe of Decia.[AN]
We've heard House Freyse[N]
is in possession of it?[A]
[Left]
Seriously? You're just here[N]
chasing some old wives' tales?[AN]
Are you lot daft?[A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Milord! You speak out of turn.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Hey, I just spoke my mind. Dug it out[N]
of my basement. Take the damn thing.[A]
[Right]
This is it? It's utterly shattered.[N]
I can hardly recognise it as an axe.[A]
[FarRight]
[Beat]There's no mistake.[N]
It's exactly as Kwame described it.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
I hope you're satisfied.[N]
Let's be off, Epony,[AN]
we have better things to be doing[N]
than chasing down some old legend.[A][X]

## EndEvent2Text
[FarLeft][LoadEpony]
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[FarLeft]
Please forgive His Lordship for his[N]
brusqueness, it's been a trying time.[AN]
I hope that his attitude doesn't[N]
dissuade you from any future relations?[A]
[FarRight]
Of course not. Our common foe[N]
is much more important.[A]
[FarLeft]
I'm glad you're not easily angered. I[N]
hope our alliance can be a lasting one.[A][X]

## EndEvent3Text
[MidLeft][LoadLoeweAngry]
[MidRight][LoadCleo]
[MidLeft]
This is ridiculous.[N]
Is Kwame having us on?[A]
[MidRight]
Perhaps the other weapons[N]
are less[Beat] battered.[A]
[MidLeft]
Hah, they better be. We've[N]
fought someone else's battle,[AN]
and all we've got in return[N]
is belittlement and some junk.[A]
[MidRight]
It's not a waste. We've still dealt[N]
a blow to the Empire regardless.[A]
[MidLeft]
You're right, Cleo. But are we[N]
going to continue this path?[AN]
We are going to chase superstitions[N]
while Dragana lies unavenged,[AN]
while Cidor walks free?[A]
[MidRight]
I'm not certain. Kwame's story[N]
was a spark of hope but[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][LoadLoewe]
Do you think it's possible it was[N]
crafted to diverge our attention?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
It's not impossible. But he did[N]
give us a much-needed hand when he[N]
could have sold us to the Empire.[AN]
Even if he truly believes in these[N]
tales, it is very possible that[N]
like the Axe, they're all well rusted.[A]
[MidLeft]
Now that Dragana no longer guides[N]
us, we bear the responsibility[N]
of all those lives.[AN]
We can't afford to take[N]
meaningless risks.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Old tales aside, our current[N]
course of action doesn't change.[AN]
A victory in Freyse may be the[N]
turning point we need.[A]
[MidLeft]
This Korovai fellow doesn't[N]
seem like an easy ally to make.[A]
[MidRight]
It's what we've got. Being an ass[N]
doesn't mean he's a less valuable ally.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]I will trust your judgment.[A][X]

I saw. You were with them the[N]

Did you sell us out on the[N]
promise of gold? Of glory?[A] 
[MidLeft]
I didn't know! They promised that[N]
no harm would come to the village.[A]

That excuses nothing. Get out of[N]
my sight, you traitorous worm.[AN]
Don't think that your pity will[N]
relieve you of your sins.[A]

Did he sell us out on the[N]

Him and so many others died,[N]
all over some damned rice[Beat][A][X]

What were you doing in a barrel?[AN]

Well[Beat] Far be it from me to guess why,[N]
but them enemies of ours left me be.[AN]
I'm not one to pass up good fortune,[N]
and this seemed the best hiding place.[N]
How's the rest of Shagahn looking?[AN]

There's nothing left of our home.[AN]

What? But how? Didn't they cut[N]
you down to reach that Freysian lord?[AN]
[MidLeft]
They did, but I guess they felt bad.[AN]
Stopped just short of the fatal blow[N]
and captured me instead, you see.[AN]

That's[Beat] I can't see why they would,[N]
but I won't question their motives.[AN]
I'm glad you're still alive, Giant.[AN]

You're planning to take it to 'em,[N]

Well, as much as I'd like to brag,[N]
it wasn't thanks to my strength.[AN]
They roughed me up and had me beat,[N]
but then they threw me off the throne.[AN]
Maybe they just pitied an old man.[AN]

When everything's over,[N]
we'll come back to Shagahn[N]
