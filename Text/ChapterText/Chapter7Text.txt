## RadnitzMifanText
[MidRight][LoadMifan]
[MidLeft][LoadRadnitz]
[MidLeft]
I will ask you one more time.[N]
We need those supplies.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
What gives you the right?[N]
Our village needs this[N]
harvest for the winter.[A]
[MidLeft]
As citizens of Freyse, you should[N]
be honoured to provide for our[N]
cause to drive back the Empire![A]
[MidRight]
What have you damned nobles ever[N]
done for us beside take and take?[N]
Why must we care about your pride?[A]
[MidLeft]
I tire of this. We will have those[N]
supplies, by force or otherwise.[A]
[MidRight]
You threaten us like common[N]
bandits. We will not concede our[N]
harvest to the likes of you![A]
[MidLeft]
If you will not give to the cause,[N]
then you are dogs of the Empire![AN]
Men! Forward! Crush these [N]
scum before Freyse's might![A][X]


## RadnitzEponyText
[MidRight][LoadEpony]
[MidLeft][LoadRadnitz]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Oof! Putting my life on the[N]
line for a few bags of rice?[N]
Nothing has changed.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Lord Radnitz, you must fall back![N]
You can't risk your life like this.[A]
[MidLeft]
I can defeat him![N]
Just give me-[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You're the heir of House of[N]
Freyse now. You should do well[N]
to remember your status.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I'm sorry. What do[N]
you suggest we do?[A]
[MidRight]
The Empire's forces will[N]
be on us very soon.[AN]
It would be far too risky for us[N]
to take serious casualties here.[A]
[MidLeft]
Must we abandon this prize[N]
so close at hand?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Of course not. I have been[N]
in contact with some allies[N]
to bear that risk for us.[AN]
If they are not victorious[N]
before the Empire's[N]
reinforcements arrive,[AN]
then they will make for a[N]
nice distraction as we retreat.[A][X]


## LoeweCleoIberisText
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[MidLeft][LoadIberis]
[Right][OneLineBox]
So Iber-[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
That's Lady Iberis to you, Decian.[N]
I expect the minimum from a commoner.[A]
[Right]
LADY Iberis, these are the[N]
enemies of the rebellion?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You heard me the first time.[N]
These traitorous turncoats have[N]
sold themselves to the Empire,[AN]
despite all House Freyse has[N]
done for them![AN]
Crushing these scum and securing[N]
their supplies would be an easy[N]
task for you.[A]
[FarRight][TwoLineBox]
And you want us to do all this, just[N]
for an audience with Lord Radnitz?[A]
[MidLeft]
We must be sure that you are[N]
worthy of assisting his lordship.[A]
[Right]
This is ridiculous, you've promised[N]
us nothing of substance for our help.[A]
[FarRight]
We've come all this way, Loewe.[N]
Every blow against the Empire counts.[A]
[Right]
Fine. I expect our demands[N]
to be met in return.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
That's not for me or you to decide.[A][X]

## MifanGiantText
[MidRight][LoadMifan]
[MidLeft][LoadTheGiant]
[MidRight]
Damn, there's more raiders coming![N]
Fate must be conspiring against us.[A]
[MidLeft]
Mi, I'll hold them off here.[N]
I'll buy us the time we need.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Against all of them?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You can trust me. Go deal with the rest[N]
of them, I'll make sure these dastards[N]
don't take a single step in our village.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
If you can't hold them off, just[N]
run! Don't force yourself.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
That won't happen.[A][X]


## WellworthMifanText
[MidRight][LoadMifan]
[MidLeft][LoadWellworth]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I hear the enemies at the gates![N]
They'll have to step over my[N]
corpse to get to our harvest![A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Please just stay inside,[N]
leave the fighting to us.[A]
[MidLeft]
You need me out there.[N]
I'm not too old for battle![A]
[MidRight]
Grandpa, we got it under control.[N]
There's no need for you to fight.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Of course you have, you're the[N]
granddaughter of the Great Wellworth![N]
Give them hell for me![A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I will![A][X]

## AxelAlexIfAliveText
[MidRight][LoadAlex]
[MidLeft][LoadAxel]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
That armoured fellow on a[N]
horse. I trust my eyes,[N]
is that who I think it is?[A]
[MidRight]
Damn. The similarities are uncanny,[N]
but that's the heir to House Freyse.[N]
It can't be.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
What if it is? I don't[N]
believe in coincidences.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
When we fled that botched heist,[N]
I thought he was dead for certain.[N]
But to reappear like this?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
It can't hurt for us to ask. The[N]
Jackal Gang doesn't give up it's own.[A][X]


## EndEvent1Text
[Right][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight][LoadCleo]
[Left][LoadRadnitz]
[FarLeft][LoadEpony]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
You've done well. [A]
[Right][TwoLineBox]
I hope that was enough of [N]
a "show of good faith."[A]
[Left]
Wasn't anything I couldn't have done.[N]
Regardless, a favour is a favour.[A]
[FarRight]
We were chasing up a lead[N]
on the Axe of Decia.[AN]
We've heard House Freyse[N]
is in possession of it?[A]
[Left]
Seriously? You're just here chasing[N]
some old wives' tales? Are you lot daft? [A]
[FarLeft][OneLineBox]
Milord! You speak out of turn.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
Hey, I just spoke my mind. Dug it out[N]
of my basement. Take the damn thing.[A]
[Right]
This is it? It is utterly shattered.[N]
I can hardly recognise it as an axe.[A]
[FarRight][OneLineBox]
... The markings match Kwame's tales.[A]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
I hope you're satisfied.[N]
Let's be off, Epony,[AN]
we have better things to be doing[N]
than chasing down some old legend.[A]
[ClearFace]
[FarLeft]
Please forgive his lordship for his[N]
brusqueness, it's been a trying time.[AN]
I hope that his attitude doesn't[N]
dissuade you from any future relations?[A]
[FarRight]
Of course not. Our common foe[N]
is much more important.[A]
[FarLeft]
I'm glad you're not easily angered. I[N]
hope our alliance can be a lasting one.[A]
[ClearFace]
[FarRight]
[MoveMidRight]
[Right]
[MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft]
This is ridiculous.[N]
Is Kwame having us on? [A]
[MidRight]
Perhaps the other weapons[N]
are less... battered.[A]
[MidLeft]
Hah, they better be. We've[N]
fought someone else's battle,[AN]
and all we've got in return[N]
is belittlement and some junk.[A]
[MidRight]
It's not a waste. We've still dealt[N]
a blow to the Empire regardless.[A]
[MidLeft]
You're right, Cleo. But are we[N]
going to continue this path?[AN]
We are going to chase superstitions[N]
while General Dragana lies unavenged,[AN]
while Cidor walks free?[A]
[MidRight]
I'm not certain. Kwame's story[N]
was a spark of hope but...[A]
[MidLeft]
Do you think it's possible it was[N]
crafted to diverge our attention?[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
It's not impossible. But he did[N]
give us a much-needed hand when he[N]
could have sold us to the Empire.[AN]
Even if he truly believes in these[N]
tales, it is very possible that[N]
like the Axe, they're all well rusted.[A]
[MidLeft]
Now that Dragana no longer guides[N]
us, we bear the responsibility[N]
of all those lives.[AN]
We can't afford to take[N]
meaningless risks.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Old tales aside, our current[N]
course of action doesn't change.[AN]
A victory in Freyse may be the[N]
turning point we need.[A]
[MidLeft]
This Radnitz fellow doesn't[N]
seem like an easy ally to make.[A]
[MidRight]
It's what we've got. Being an ass[N]
doesn't mean he's a less valuable ally.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I will trust your judgment.[A][X]


## EndEvent2Text
[MidRight][LoadMifan]
[MidLeft][LoadBuldak]
[MidLeft]
You're awake![N]
Thank the gods![A]
[MidRight]
Buldak? What happened?[N]
I was- ...[A]
[MidLeft]
The battle is over, they've[N]
left now. You're safe.[A]
[MidRight]
I remember now.[N]
I saw what you did.[A] 
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Wha- What do you mean?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I saw. You were with them the[N]
whole time weren't you?[AN]
Did you sell us out on the[N]
promise of gold? Of glory?[A] 
[MidLeft]
I didn't know! They promised that[N]
no harm would come to the village.[A]
[MidRight]
That excuses nothing. Get out of[N]
my sight, you traitorous worm.[AN]
Don't think that your pity will[N]
relieve you of your sins.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Mi, please-[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
If I see you again,[N]
I will kill you.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
I'm sorry.[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Freyse, Decian Liberators, this[N]
crime will not go unanswered.[A][X]



## AxelTalkCh7Text
[MidRight][LoadAxel]
[MidLeft][LoadRadnitz]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Xale? Is that you?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Xale? You're speaking to Lord[N]
Radnitz, heir to House of Freyse![A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
No, that's definitely you! Surely-[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Preposterous, you would mix me[N]
up with some common man?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I see. Forgive me, milord.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You are forgiven. I can tell[N]
that you're a fine warrior,[N]
so this should serve you well.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Xa- Milord-[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I have more important matters[N]
to attend to. [A]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight]
So you haven't quite[N]
forgotten us, good man.[A][X]


## AlexTalkCh7Text

[MidLeft][LoadRadnitz]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
When the birds sings thrice,[A]
[MidLeft]
The arms of- ...[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Milord, I didn't know you were so well[N]
acquainted with a Chouwouj folk song.[A]
[MidLeft]
I- I- I don't know what you[N]
mean. This is a common tune.[A]
[MidRight]
A common tune about the everlasting[N]
prosperity of the Chouwouj nation?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Perhaps you're mistaken. I've[N]
lived my entire life in Freyse-[N]
and who are you to ask?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Sorry, I was just curious.[N]
I'll be on way now.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I saw that you've helped Freyse[N]
greatly this battle, so perhaps[N]
this gift worthy of a fine warrior.[AN]
I hear Epony calling my name.[N]
I must be off.[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Looking out for an old pal, huh?[A][X]



## RadnitzTalkCh7Text
[Left][LoadRadnitz]
[Left][LoadActive]
Have you seized their[N]
safehouse yet? Get that done.[A][X]

## RadnitzEndCh7Text
[Right][LoadActive]
[Left][LoadRadnitz]
So you liberators live up to your[N]
reputation after all. Let's talk.[A][X]

## CleoEndCh7Text
[Right][LoadCleo]
[Right]
We've won, but I don't feel victorious.[N]
This better be worth it.[A][X]

## CleoThroneCh7Text
[Right][LoadCleo]
[Right]
We've secured the perimeter. Now we just[N]
need to establish contact with Lord Freyse.[A][X]

## RecruitCh7Text
[MidRight][LoadActive]
[MidLeft][LoadBuldak]
[MidLeft]
Don't kill me! I'm Ibelis' contact,[N]
did she not mention me?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I have no idea.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
That pompous- Take my word[N]
for it. And my sword.[A][X]


## VillageCh7Text
[MidLeft][LoadMan1]
[MidRight][LoadActive]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Life has been better under the[N]
Empire, but of course Freyse must[N]
drag us down with them.[AN]
I would be out there fighting,[N]
if not for my failing vision.[AN]
Good fellow, take this and[N]
fight them off! [A][X]

## SupplyCh7Text
Rice supplies secured.[A][X]

## InfoText
Cleo and Loewe must both seize[N]
the throne and talk to Radnitz[N]
to win, before the 15th turn.[AN]
Each supply shed secured increases[N]
the reward at the end of the chapter.[A][X]

## Rice0Ch7Text
[Left][LoadRadnitz]
[Left]
You got none of the supplies?[N]
Disappointing, but as expected.[A][X]

## Rice1Ch7Text
[Left][LoadRadnitz]
[Left]
Did you bunch loot a shack or a supply depot?[N]
I could probably finish all this myself.[A][X]

## Rice2Ch7Text
[Left][LoadRadnitz]
[Left]
This is all the rice you secured? Wow,[N]
what an incredible accomplishment![AN]
For an army half your size, maybe.[A][X]

## Rice3Ch7Text
[Left][LoadRadnitz]
[Left]
Are you expecting some kind of[N]
praise of doing the bare minimum?[AN]
Fine, Epony would nag if I didn't[N]
give you some reward.[A][X]

## MifanBattleQuoteText
[MidLeft][LoadMifan]

To arms! To arms![N]
Drive back these thieves![A][X]

What the hell is[N]
going on?[AN]
I was just having[N]
a drink![A][X]
