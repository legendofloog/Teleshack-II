...So what is our next goal?[AN]
[MidLeft]
We need to pass through[N]
the Black Forest.[AN]
...Unfortunatly, Cidor already[N] 
has forces there.[AN]
[MidRight]
Doesn't sound like anything we haven't[N]
dealt with before.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Well, apparently the empire has[N]
been recruiting from nearby villages.[AN]
It seems like popular opinion is[N]
turning against us...[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I wish I could say I'm suprised.[AN]
Maybe deciding to work with Radnitz...[AN]
[MidLeft]
We've been over this.[AN]
...In addition, [Red]allegedly some empire[N]
veterans will be arriving soon.[AN]
We'll need to hurry.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Red]...What will stop them[N]
from pursuing us?[AN]
[MidLeft]
There is a gate[N]
within the forest.[AN]
If we pass through[N]
and seal it behind us,[AN]
we should be able to[N]
buy ourselves time to escape.[AN]
[MidRight]
...It'll have to do.[N]
Let's go join the others.[A][X]

gotten myself into now?[AN]
Fighting for the empire...[Beat][AN]

## JennySpawnText
[MidRight][LoadJenny]
[Beat]...There they are.[N]
The Liberators.[AN]
...I don't trust these[N]
empire goons.[A] Can what they[N]
say really be true?[AN]
[Red]After what the Liberators[N]
did for my sis...[AN]
If they wanna talk, I[N]
should at least hear em' out.[Red][A][X]


##MeldanSpawnText
[MidRight][LoadMeldan]
Oh me, oh my...[Beat][A]
The time has come.[AN]
...Oh, I can't do this![AN]
[Red]Not after what the[N]
rebels did for my friend![Red][AN]
Maybe I can sneak away...[Beat][AN]
The empire did say that the[N]
rebels were dangerous...[AN]
[Red]Can't let my guard down.[Red][A][X]

My sister always spoke[N]
highly of you.[AN]

her life. I owe you one.[AN]

[FarLeft][LoadActive]
[FarRight][LoadMeldan]
Rebels! Oh, uh, Liberators![AN]
You've been rumored to be[N]
doing ill as of late![AN]
But my good friend Helman[N]
owes you a debt![AN]
So I shall be joining you![AN]
I shall help set you straight![AN]
No need to thank me![AN]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[FarRight]
[Beat]...Phew, looks like[N]
they bought it.[A][X]

[FarRight][LoadRadnitz]
[Beat]...[AN]
[CloseEyes]Maybe...[AN]
Maybe listening to their[N]
council was a mistake...[AN]
[FarFarLeft][LoadCleo]
Milord?[AN]
[MoveLeft]
[FarLeft][LoadLoewe]
[FarRight]
[OpenEyes]Oh! There you are[AN]
You fought well out there.[AN]
[Left]
Thank you, Milord.[AN]
[FarRight]
...I must appologize.[AN]
[FarLeft]
???[A]
[Left]
Milord?[A]
[FarRight]
[CloseEyes]..My strategy has turned[N]
my own people against me.[AN]
I thought it would be[N]
necessary to defeat the empire.[AN]
But now the future of Freyse...[AN]
And I've dragged the[N]
Liberators into my mess.[AN]
[Left]
...[A]
[FarLeft]
...[A]
[FarRight]
I'm sorry, I'm sure I've caused[N]
you a great deal of heartache.[AN]
[Beat]...[A]
[ClearFace]
[FarLeft]
...Wasn't expecting that.[A]
[Left]
I wonder who he...?[AN]
Nevermind for now. We need[N]
to focus. On what comes next.[A]
[FarLeft]
Right. Let's.[A][X]
