Congratulations on beating Bells of Byelen![N]
With Cherne's defeat, the Decian Liberators[N]
have succeeded and can rest at last.[AN]
There are future plans for a postgame[N]
taking place in the Yuria Isles,[N]
but for now, this is the end of the line.[AN]
This chapter will appear much different[N]
when a postgame is implemented, likely[N]
having various challenge maps and secrets.[AN]
Until then though, this chapter mostly[N]
serves as a place to look at your units[N]
and see how they've progressed so far.[AN]
If you have any feedback, bug reports,[N]
or thoughts about the hack, please leave[N]
it in the FEU thread or the Discord[N]
so that we can see and make use of it.[AN]
Anyway, thanks for playing,[N]
and we hope you enjoyed Bells of Byelen![N]
[N]
- Team Adversity[A][X]

Grr... I came here to fight in the arena,[N]
but apparently, it's not even open![AN]
The arenamaster said it'd be soon,[N]
but I'm not holding my breath.[AN]
He's quite famous for his delays![AN][X]
