He would focus on spellcraft and go[N]
on to invent all sorts of new ways[N]
to fry, shock, and freeze people.[X]

## MinkAugurEnding
The last weeks of the Augur's life would be among[N]
her happiest, adding a few last memories[N]
to the ones she would share. In the end, Mink[N]
would write, though not of history of the Augur,[N]
but of the life of Reinhilde, the friend.[X]

## MinkKwameEnding
Mink struggled to reconcile the motives of Kwame's[N]
actions; that the vast tapestry of history,[N]
his life's work, could be so easily reduced to a[N]
single name. His body was found amidst a pile[N]
of history books and many, many wine bottles.[X]

## TiberiusEnding
Shortly after, Tiberius disappeared from the[N]
annals of history. Around the same time,[N]
numerous accounts began to circulate of a[N]
masked knight errant roaming the Decian[N]
countryside, lending aid to strangers in need.[X]

## Tiberius_Ojasvi_Ending
Ojasvi and Tiberius traveled together[N]
to help those displaced by the war.[N]
One day, Tiberius disappeared, and Ojasvi[N]
was deeply saddened to lose her friend,[N]
but would later cross a familiar masked rider.[X]

## MantouEnding
Mantou hated the discipline and stringent[N]
rules of the army. Convincing a few disgruntled[N]
soldiers to defect, they took to the mountains[N]
as brigands. Somehow, they were remembered as[N]
folk heroes despite never doing any good.[X]

## EllereyEnding
Ellerey decided to further xer steelworking[N]
skills, and wound up becoming Decia's finest.[N]
In xer old age, xe instead opted[N]
to teach a new generation xer skills.[X]

## DarbyEllereyEnding
Following the war, Ellerey expanded[N]
xer skills under the teachings of Darby.[N]
Ellerey's mastery of metalworking and[N]
weaponry only expanded, and xe[N]
shared a close lifelong bond with Darby.[X]

## JacinthEllereyEnding
After Cherne's defeat, Ellerey put[N]
xer lance down and focused solely[N]
on smithing. Jacinth always supported[N]
xem in all aspects, and they were[N]
forever happy together.[X]

## TippanyEnding
Tippany's quest to help others continued,[N]
despite Cherne's defeat. She remained behind[N]
in Cythes, using her healing aptitude to aid[N]
the common people. One day, she collapsed from[N]
overwork, surrounded by those she had helped.[X]

## TakaiEnding
After the war, Takai went back to his hometown.[N]
His good nature led him to helping people[N]
from all walks of life in any way he could.[N]
Despite this hard work, he still made[N]
countless hours with his family.[X]

## TakaiShawEnding
For five years, the two pit fighters trained[N]
relentlessly to prepare for the Yurian Cup.[N]
Fans packed into the Grand Oceanic Arena to[N]
watch them. Tales of their battle became legends,[N]
being the first arena finals to end in a draw.[X]

## PelecayeEnding
Having failed in finding the plant he searched[N]
for while he was in Mahemen with the Liberators,[N]
Pelecaye returned to the country after the war.[N]
A new plant used with beverages soon spread in[N]
Mahemen, but Pelecaye was never seen again.[X]

## JoiePelecayeEnding
The armored duo excitedly set off to Mahemen,[N]
and with the addition of Joie's innate strength,[N]
Pelecaye at last managed to find the plant.[N]
Overlooked initially, its starches, as pearls,[N]
became a common addition to Mahemeni beverages.[X]

## CarlEnding
Carl left shortly after the final battle, still[N]
dissatisfied with his sword prowess. Over the[N]
years, his reputation grew as an unconventional,[N]
yet highly skilled swordsman. He never took on[N]
disciples, and his unique style died with him.[X]

## CarlAshaEnding
The duo set off to the Mahemeni sands, searching[N]
for the temple containing the Sword of Light.[N]
They found many other ruins in the process,[N]
becoming rich off their treasures, but it is[N]
unknown whether they ever found their target.[X]

## CarlSeraEnding
As promised, Carl and Sera dueled once more[N]
after Cherne's defeat. When Sera tripped Carl[N]
with a leg sweep, the match ended with the two[N]
bursting into laughter. They then went their[N]
separate ways, but reconnected decades later.[X]

## JacinthEnding
Jacinth returned to Chouwouj a hero.[N]
She ended up leaving dancing,[N]
favoring the research of producing[N]
her favorite types of sparkling drink.[X]

## ApsisJacinthEnding
Following the war, Jacinth and[N]
Apsis tracked down Veid, where they[N]
managed to retrieve Cherne's Inkwell.[N]
The inkwell was a fraud, prompting the[N]
two to go on a journey to find the truth.[X]

## DarbyJacinthEnding
Following the war, Darby and[N]
Jacinth founded a new pub,[N]
famous for their juicy steak[N]
and mouthwatering drinks.[N]
They were an inseparable duo.[X]

## DarbyEnding
Having seen the horrors of war firsthand,[N]
Darby decided to put down her bow and walk[N]
a road of pacifism, encouraging others[N]
to resolve conflicts peacefully[N]
and only fight as an absolute last resort.[X]

## NahizaEnding
At Archbishop Kailani's side, Nahiza helped[N]
rebuild Mahemen. She was put in charge[N]
of the theocracy's siege corps, and turned[N]
out to be a surprisingly competent[N]
peacetime leader.[X]

## NahizaRashidEnding
Nahiza and Rashid both retired from war. The[N]
latter found that becoming a teacher was his[N]
hidden passion all along; his teaching style,[N]
wandering through the classroom giving help,[N]
was still famed as that of the Sidewinder.[X]

## NahizaJerryEnding
Nahiza and Jerry returned to their homes.[N]
Years later, they both traveled to the[N]
Yuria Archipelago on vacation. There,[N]
they shared a keg of Jerry's[N]
favorite Chouwoujian alcohol.[X]

## AugurEnding
The Augur died of old age just weeks after[N]
Cherne's defeat. On her deathbed, she[N]
eschewed a state funeral for a common[N]
soldier's, and said she was proud[N]
of the life she'd led.[X]

## AugurRashidEnding
Rashid and Reinhilde returned to the place[N]
where the Augur had discovered her blessing.[N]
With the last of their lives, they built a[N]
memorial amidst the ruins - for Rashid, Rodney,[N]
and countless other long-forgotten dead.[X]

## AugurCatrinEnding
Taking Reinhilde's words to heart, Catrin chose[N]
to live on, mending her relationship with her[N]
her son and honoring her husband's memory.[N]
When the Augur fell ill years later, Catrin[N]
rushed to her and cared for her until the end.[X]

## IlseEnding
Ilse returned to her homeland of Mahemen,[N]
changed by her battle against the god she[N]
once served. She led reformist efforts[N]
in the Church of Byelen, promoting doctrine[N]
that argued against growing calls for war.[X]

## IlseOjasviEnding
After the war, Ojasvi grieved for her family,[N]
for she knew now they were all lost. Ilse[N]
lovingly adopted Ojasvi as her granddaughter,[N]
and Ojasvi cared for her until she passed.[N]
Ojasvi vanished shortly thereafter.[X]

## AshaEnding
Asha left Houvaina's service after Cythes[N]
fell, choosing instead to venture into unknown[N]
parts of Mahemen in search of lost treasure.[N]
After her passing, many searched Mahemen for[N]
her hidden treasure, but none found a trace.[X]

## AshaOjasviEnding
The duo began a business finding[N]
rare treasures, using the profits[N]
to help those most in need.[N]
They became seen as saviors to the[N]
most vulnerable across the continent.[X]

## KofiEnding
Kofi turned down a position to be a royal[N]
researcher for Cythes, instead returning to his[N]
nomadic quest for knowledge, traveling around[N]
in search of new insights, writing many accounts[N]
of the era which informed what we know today.[X]

## KofiKwameEnding
Kofi went in search of Luthando's Shrine[N]
and promptly vanished from history.[N]
Later accounts would state that they'd[N]
occasionally hear unnatural noises from[N]
the deep jungle that sounded like weeping.[X]

## Kofi_Nikolas_Ending
Kofi took Nikolas's words to heart[N]
and tried to live a bit more simply.[N]
While his passion to search for truth[N]
never faded, some scholars argue it was[N]
supplanted by a love for friendship.[X]

## RashidEnding
After the war, Rashid felt more at ease[N]
than he'd felt in ages. So much so,[N]
he would one day fall asleep and disappear[N]
entirely, for his soul would rest. Some[N]
question if he ever was truly there at all.[X]

## RashidNikolasEnding
Nikolas continued to ask Rashid[N]
questions about his mysterious skills,[N]
and although Rashid, in his attempts to[N]
repent, would reply earnestly,[N]
he never seemed to get a word in.[X]

## NikolasEnding
Confused and not really sure what happened,[N]
Nikolas returned to business as usual; bumbling[N]
from place to place performing odd jobs and[N]
being generally affable. Every village needs[N]
an idiot, and his village was Orodreth.[X]

## ShawEnding
Shaw continued as a gladiator, to moderate[N]
success. After an injury ended his fighting[N]
career, he devoted his efforts to managing[N]
and promoting the Grand Oceanic Arena,[N]
which he found both lucrative and fulfilling.[X]

## ShawSeraEnding
After the war's end, Sera and Shaw proved[N]
triumphant in the finals of Grand Oceanic[N]
Arena. Sera left to travel the world, but[N]
returned every five years to compete[N]
alongside her friend.[X]

## SeraEnding
After the final battle, Sera said her goodbyes[N]
and departed, seeking new fights. She fought[N]
in numerous small-scale conflicts across the[N]
continent, but never joined another army. When[N]
she finally put down her blade, she was content.[X]

## OjasviEnding
She returned to Mahemen to learn her family[N]
had all perished in the war. She'd attempt[N]
to revive her father's textile empire,[N]
but never really enjoyed the work, instead[N]
wishing she could've pursued the arts.[X]

## TaoEnding
Tao returned to his home in Freyse, and for[N]
many years, he quietly worked as a fletcher.[N]
When House Freyse threatened to rise again,[N]
he rejoined Trajan's forces to ensure that[N]
his cousin, Mifan, did not die in vain.[X]

## JoieEnding
With the war ended, Joie returned home to Decia.[N]
Now a renowned hero, she worked tirelessly to[N]
help Decia get back on her feet. Joie spent her[N]
time helping the common folk more than nobles.[N]
In her later years, she would retire as a farmer.[X]

## JoieLockeEnding
Joie set off to the Yurian Isles, becoming[N]
an instant star in the Grand Oceanic Arena[N]
rivaled only by Locke. After Joie won in their[N]
final bout, Locke revealed his dark past,[N]
but Joie lost interest and never repeated it.[X]

## ZharaEnding
Devastated by finding out about Byelen's[N]
duplicity, Zhara became despondent.[N]
For a short while, anyways. Even god's[N]
treachery couldn't stay her from destiny,[N]
and she resumed her travels anew.[X]

## GrotoEnding
For reasons as unknown to scholars as his[N]
original joining, Groto left the Liberators[N]
immediately after the war. However, tales[N]
of his telepathic exploits became children's[N]
stories that became popular throughout Orodreth.[X]

## GrotoApsis_Ending
The pair parted after the war.[N]
Apsis would try to write Groto,[N]
but never heard back. He was[N]
forlorn over the loss of his friend, but he'd[N]
occasionally hear his voice in his mind.[X]

## ApsisEnding
Having tuned his magical aptitude,[N]
Apsis would leave behind Orodreth,[N]
writing an extensive chronicle on his[N]
travels. His writings would serve as[N]
the only proof that he ever existed.[X]

## VolranEnding
Unlike what his friend predicted,[N]
Volran did not abandon magic like he[N]
had with other fleeting interests.[N]
Even with his meager natural talent, he[N]
made an excellent researcher and teacher.[X]

## VolranTaraEnding
Volran continued to push his magical[N]
abilities, in part thanks to Tara's[N]
encouragement. They'd continue to take jobs[N]
together, and despite their new differences,[N]
they were still unstoppable together.[X]

## TaraEnding
While she was upset that Volran never[N]
returned to his sword, Tara continued[N]
to develop her unique fighting style.[N]
Many would pay a small fortune to have[N]
her blade by their side.[X]

## JerryEnding
After the war, Jerry would wander all[N]
over Orodreth, causing ruckus and[N]
picking fights in local taverns[N]
and inns. His reckless behavior[N]
would prove to be his end.[X]

## JerryLyreEnding
Despite the difficulties, Jerry managed to wean[N]
himself off the flask, thanks to his resolve[N]
and Lyre's help. He became the leader for her[N]
rebellion, one that would change Chouwouj[N]
forever and cement the two as legends.[X]

## LyreEnding
Lyre returned to Chouwouj, writing[N]
of her adventures, and later decided[N]
to travel across the land. She would[N]
later encounter many familiar faces[N]
during a fateful day...[X]

## CatrinEnding
Catrin assisted with the rebuilding of[N]
Wustheim, and was later elected mayor.[N]
Although she struggled to ever reconnect[N]
with Loewe, the people of Mahemen[N]
still saw her as a hero.[X]

## KwameCatrinEnding
Even after his betrayal, Kwame's words stuck[N]
in Catrin's mind. Fearing Loewe's death, she[N]
became his bodyguard after his coronation as[N]
archbishop. The two's bond decayed, but Catrin[N]
met her end repelling a blade meant for him.[X]

## NgondalaEnding
Having lost her faith, Ngondala returned to[N]
Chouwouj and abandoned her role as a[N]
warlord. Once peace returned to the[N]
land, she spent a simple life with her[N]
family in the mountains.[X]

## NgondalaKwameEnding
Following a traitor's advice, Ngondala tried[N]
to continue her campaign to bring Chouwouj[N]
peace. However, her efforts ended in ruin. The[N]
jungles burned, and Ngondala and her family[N]
fled the wartorn lands to an unknown fate.[X]

## Ngondala_Locke_Ending
Locke went back with Ngondala to Chouwouj.[N]
Although Locke thought it'd just be one job,[N]
he fell in love with Chouwouj's climate.[N]
Ngondala treated him well, and he took on jobs[N]
some might even consider honorable.[X]

## TrajanEnding
Trajan returned to Decia, establishing a[N]
council chosen by representatives of each town.[N]
He used his experience as a Liberator veteran[N]
to lead Decia's reconstruction, devoting all[N]
his time to his vow with a fallen friend.[X]

## TrajanBoroEnding
Trajan returned to Decia, establishing a[N]
council chosen by representatives of each town.[N]
As master of arms, Boro trained local militia,[N]
teaching them all he knew about combat in order[N]
to protect the peace that both men fought for.[X]

## LockeEnding
With the reputation Locke had earned fighting[N]
in the war, he was able to secure far better[N]
mercenary work than he had before. However,[N]
it is a dangerous line of work, and Locke would[N]
eventually lose his life on a dangerous job.[X]

## EliasEnding
Elias established a band of knights, the Order[N]
of Coralia, who kept the peace while Cythes[N]
recovered from near ruin. Their commander[N]
worked tirelessly towards this end, attributing[N]
his resolve to an old friend's dying wish.[X]

## BoroEnding
After Cherne's defeat, Boro initially went back[N]
to his old ways as a mercenary for the wealthy.[N]
However, when a Decian noble attempted to hire[N]
him to lead an insurrection, he refused and[N]
rejoined the fight under Trajan's banner.[X]

## BarodEnding
Finally having found meaning in his life of[N]
endless battle, Barod was all too happy to[N]
let go of his immortal chains. His was not[N]
a meeting with Death, but a reunion between[N]
two partners in crime.[X]

## OrfeasEnding
His empire shattered by divine treachery,[N]
Orfeas solemnly began the long road to[N]
rebuilding trust with the Cythean people.[N]
However, in his old age, he knew he would[N]
not live to see his work come to fruition.[X]

## TarajiEnding
Not a single soul in Orodreth mourned her[N]
passing. Nevertheless, her long life of[N]
violence and conquest ensured that the[N]
Pitviper's name and deeds would never[N]
be forgotten.[X]

## AthanEnding
His lifeless body was found hours after[N]
Cherne's defeat. Cleo and Loewe wished[N]
they could have done more for him,[N]

him the peace he was denied in life.[X]
