Filone, open your eyes![A]
[MidRight]
H-Huh? Who is it?![A]
[FarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][TwoLineBox]
What are you, asleep?[N]
It's me, Alena.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox][MidBlink]
O-Oh, Miss Alena. No,[N]
I wasn't sleepin', honest![AN]
I just[Beat][CloseEyes] lost focus[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]You're doing it again,[N]
so that's not very convincing.[AN]
Did you stay up late?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox][MidBlink]
Only a little! I was doin' some extra[N]
trainin', to catch up to everyone.[AN]
I know I ain't worth much, not like[N]
you, but I don't wanna be a burden.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
But you were, just now. If someone[N]
had snuck up while you were out of it,[N]
I would've had to cut them down.[AN]
That's more of a burden than[N]
just doing what you always do.[AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
[Beat]Sorry, Miss Alena.[N]
I won't do it again.[AN]
It's just[Beat] my pa always tells me[N]
the same thing, to be careful,[N]
but I can't stay like I am now.[AN]
I wanna become strong, like you,[N]
so I can protect everyone else![AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox][ToggleSmile]
You think I'm strong?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Yeah! Your sword goes all[Beat] swoosh![AN]
It's so fast, I can hardly see it.[N]
Wish I could do that with my bow![AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Look, if you want to get stronger[N]
that bad, then training more is good.[AN]
That being said, you can't let it[N]
worsen your focus. Talk to me the[N]
next time you train outside of drills.[AN]
I'll make sure you don't overwork[N]
yourself and show you some tricks,[N]
if you're that curious about them.[AN]
[MidRight]
Really? Alright, that sounds awesome![N]
Thanks, Miss Alena. You won't regret it![AN][X]

Hey, hey![N]
Miss Alena![AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Ah, Filone. You seem more energetic[N]
lately, so you must not be doing[N]
any extra extra training, right?[AN]
[MidRight]
O-Of course not! Your regimen's[N]
got me so exhausted by the end[N]
that I crawl in my bunk and lay there.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha! That just means it's working.[AN]
Well, you don't want that fatigue[N]
to carry over to the battlefield,[N]
but it's a good kind of pain.[AN]
It means you're getting stronger.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yeah, it used to be hard for me[N]
to do much of anythin' against[N]
someone in a one-on-one fight.[AN]
With your exercises though,[N]
my arrows pack a real punch now![AN]
[MidLeft]
That's good. Self-reliance is[N]
an important trait, Filone.[AN]
It separates the weak from the strong.[N]
We have capable allies, no doubt,[N]
but you can't count on them alone.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Sorry if I'm pryin', Miss Alena,[N]
but are you speakin' from experience?[AN]
Your eyes look[Beat] lonely, I guess.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Heh[Beat] You can see right through me,[N]
huh? Yeah, your intuition is right.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]
Do you[Beat] wanna talk about it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No, not really.[A] I appreciate it,[N]
but it's a long story and not[N]
particularly unique, I'm afraid.[AN]
Just one more orphan on the street[N]
with only a knife in her hand[Beat][AN]
Ah, there I go telling it, huh?[N]
Sorry, Filone. Let's get back[N]
to the battle for now, alright?[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Miss Alena[Beat] You've helped me so[N]
much, so I can't just ignore this.[AN]
Sorry, but I'm helpin' you,[N]
whether you want it or not![AN][X]

Miss Alena, do you have a second?[N]
I wanted to talk about somethin'.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
What's with the formalities, Filone?[AN]
I think we know each other well enough[N]
that you can drop that [OpenQuote]Miss" thing.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ah, then[Beat] Alena, I wanted to thank[N]
you for everythin' you've done for me.[AN]
I feel like I'm not a burden anymore[Beat][N]
Though I still have a ways to go[N]
before I'm as strong as the others.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]No need to be down on yourself,[N]
Filone. You've long since reached[N]
my level, if not surpassed it.[AN]
I doubt you need to train with me[N]
anymore, since you've come this far.[AN]
[MidRight]
That's[Beat] Maybe, but I want[N]
to keep practicin' with you![AN]
Honestly, I wasn't close to many[N]
people besides my dad before I joined[N]
the Liberators, but things have changed.[AN]
I've made a bunch of friends here![AN]
Heck, some of them are like family now.[N]
And Pa always says that you help family,[N]
no matter what, so[Beat] I wanna help you![AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I[Beat] appreciate the sentiment,[N]
but [OpenQuote]help" me? With what, exactly?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
It's about that story you mentioned.[AN]
You said you didn't want to talk about[N]
it, but it seemed to me like you[N]
wanted to get it off your chest.[AN]
Maybe I'm wrong, but[Beat][N]
I'm pretty sure I'm not.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]The battlefield is no place for this,[N]
Filone. Have you learned nothing from[N]
my lessons? Maintain your focus, always.[AN]
Otherwise, you'll find a knife in your[N]
back quicker than you can blink.[AN]
[MidRight][CloseEyes][OneLineBox]
But[Beat] I only wanted to help[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Don't cry, alright? I can tell you[N]
a bit, but not here in mid-combat.[AN]
When we get back to camp,[N]
I'll tell you everything.[AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes][OneLineBox]
O-Oh! Okay![AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]One more thing, Filone.[AN]
[MidRight]
Y-Yes?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
You[Beat] No, never mind.[N]
Just stay safe, Filone.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Right![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]You're like family to me, too.[AN]
I never thought I'd say that again[N]
after losing one before, but life[N]
has a way of throwing out surprises.[AN]
I'll make sure we both make it through[N]
this and live to see peaceful days[Beat][A][X]

A fellow swordswoman? It looks like[N]
this army is more interesting than[N]
I thought. What's your name?[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Alena. Yours?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Sera. So, care for a bout after this?[AN]
You seem strong, and I'd like to see[N]
which one of us would come out on top.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Nah, I'm good. I'd rather relax[N]
and prepare for the next battle[N]
then waste my time with some duel.[AN]
[MidRight]
W-What? You[Beat] don't want to fight me?[AN]
Don't you want to prove that your style[N]
is stronger than anyone other out there,[N]
and to hone it to even greater heights?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No, not really. Can't say I have much[N]
of a style, anyhow. I swing my sword,[N]
and people die. That's enough for me.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]It seems like I misjudged you.[N]
What, then, drives your sword?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Uh, look, I'm not really one for[N]
chatting it up on the battlefield.[AN]
Let's just get this done, yeah?[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Hm[Beat] Well, that was abrupt.[AN]
So she has no technique like my[N]
dancing blade, hm? Still, I've seen[N]
her cut down as many enemies as me.[AN]
It can't be brute strength alone[Beat][N]
Interesting. Alena, we'll have that[N]
duel yet. Just wait and see![AN][X]

[Beat]You again. What do you want?[AN]
I thought I made it clear that I'm[N]
not interested in dueling you.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
You have, but I'm still not satisfied[N]
with your reasoning. Tell me something.[AN]
Do you actually want to become stronger,[N]
or are you satisfied where you are?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]It's always good to hone your skills,[N]
but one duel's not going to help much.[AN]
At least, that's the way I see it.[N]
Everything I learned, I did on my own.[AN]
I didn't have a master to teach me the[N]
ropes, so I watched other swordsmen[N]
fight and practiced based on that.[AN]
[MidRight]
Mm[Beat] Yes, your maneuvers do seem[N]
self-taught. That being said, sparring[N]
is more valuable than you're suggesting.[AN]
It solidifies your techniques against[N]
another person, without the fear of[N]
death dulling your blade at all times.[AN]
I've seen many like you, who were[N]
confident in their own power, that[N]
fell in battle due to poor fundamentals.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
That so? Well, I've survived just fine.[AN]
Each swordsman that dared challenge[N]
me only taught me more, and my sword[N]
grew sharper with each fallen enemy.[AN]
It's working so far, wouldn't you say?[N]
I'm still standing, but none of them are.[AN]
[MidRight]
Heh[Beat] That's because you haven't[N]
faced a true swordmaster yet.[AN]
Are you confident you could come[N]
out on top against someone who[N]
dedicated their life to the blade?[AN]
You, a half-hearted copycat?[N]
You're too scared to face even me.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]A copycat, huh? If you're trying[N]
to bait me into accepting that duel,[N]
then congrats. You're on, Sera.[AN]
The next chance we get, I'll show[N]
you why I've survived so long[N]
relying on only my own strength![AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Ha! At last, you show some fire.[AN]
Excellent. Let's prove who's right,[N]
speaking only with our swords![AN][X]

[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
We've waited long enough. You got your[N]
practice sword, Sera? First one to land[N]
a clean hit on the other is the winner.[AN]
[MidRight]
Of course I do, but are you sure[N]
you don't want to do this back at[N]
the base? It would be safer.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah, but there's no one else around,[N]
and we'd just get interrupted if we[N]
fought around any of our allies.[AN]
Besides[Beat] the battlefield is all[N]
I know when it comes to this.[AN]
I can't focus anywhere else when[N]
it comes to real fight, Sera.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Well, fine by me.[N]
Let's not waste any more time.[N]
Ready your blade, Alena![AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Alright! Here I come![AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[MidLeft][MoveRight][Right][MoveRight][MoveMidLeft]
[MidRight][MoveLeft][Left][MoveLeft][MoveMidRight]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Not bad, Sera.[N]
You're not all talk.[AN]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
You[Beat][OpenEyes] You've been hiding[N]
this level of strength? How?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I could say the same to you.[N]
Still, my sword is stronger![AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[MidLeft][MoveRight][MidRight][MoveFarRight][Right][MoveRight][MoveRight][MoveMidLeft]
[FarRight][ToggleSmile]
Urgh[Beat] that was close! If those blows[N]
had landed, it would've been my loss.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
One more second, and you'd[N]
be lying flat on the ground.[AN]
How much longer are you[N]
going to hold back, Sera?[N]
This is getting a bit bor-[AN]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadSeraZooming]
Heh[Beat] I never thought you'd[N]
push me this far. Well done, Alena![N]
But can you stop my dancing blade?[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's[Beat] Looks like this is one[N]
technique I can never copy. I'll[N]
have to settle with beating it![AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[MidLeft][MoveRight][MidRight][MoveFarRight][Right][MoveRight][FarRight][MoveMidRight][MidRight][MoveMidRight][Right][MoveMidLeft]
[MidLeft]
Damn it[Beat] I can't land a hit.[N]
That blade dance is too fast[Beat][N]
All I'm swinging at is air![AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Well, Alena? Do you want to yield?[N]
You can't win if you can't hit me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Don't worry, I've got one more[N]
card left to play! Take this![AN][CloseSpeechSlow]
[MidLeft][MoveRight][Right][MoveRight][MoveRight][MoveRight][MoveMidLeft]
[MidRight]
Y-You aimed for my sword instead to[N]
snap it in two? That's a dirty trick![AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hey, I didn't break any rules.[AN]
Without a sword, you can't land[N]
a hit, so I win by default.[N]
I knew I'd get the victory, but-[AN]
Wait, my practice sword is[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]You broke your own sword, too?[N]
You must have put an absurd amount[N]
of force in that one swing[Beat][AN]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadSera]
Well, what conclusion do we draw[N]
from this? That we're both right?[N]
That feels a bit unsatisfying.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Well, that's life. Still,[N]
I was wrong about one thing.[AN]
This fight[Beat][ToggleSmile] I actually enjoyed it.[N]
Honing one's swordsmanship for that[N]
alone isn't so bad, after all.[AN]
Not everything has to be about survival[N]
or fighting for a cause you believe in.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hm[Beat] You're right, but your strength[N]
today shows the value of those ideals.[AN]
I've learned quite a bit myself. Alena,[N]
we should do this again some time.[N]
But next time, I'm the one who'll win![AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Heh, I'm ready whenever you are![A][X]
