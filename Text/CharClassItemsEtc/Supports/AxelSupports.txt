[Beat]Risking my life on the frontlines[N]
yet again, eh? This is not the proper[N]
place for a noble of high birth.[AN]
Even if it is Lord Korovai's will,[N]
serving these uppity commanders is a[N]
large ask for one as esteemed as myself.[AN]
What I wouldn't do to be back at home,[N]
eating the finest pastries of Freyse[N]
and drinking Mahemeni black tea[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][LoadAxel]
Oy, Iberis! Loewe and Cleo wanted[N]
to have a word with you, quickly.[N]
It's about our tactics for this battle.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]You're from Freyse, correct?[AN]
[MidRight]
That I am. What of it?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Refer to me with the proper respect,[N]
as a lady of only the highest birth.[AN]
Using my first name is far too casual.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ha! No, I don't think that I will.[N]
House Freyse didn't have any real[N]
power before the Liberators helped you.[AN]
Last I checked, your rank in this army[N]
isn't any higher than the rest of us.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That[Beat] may be so, but I still clearly[N]
stand out from the rest of you peasants![AN]
The commanders just haven't seen fit[N]
to award me my proper status, you see.[N]
They will, in good time. I promise.[AN]
[MidRight]
Right[Beat] Well, good luck with that.[AN]
Since the message is delivered,[N]
I'm gonna take off and keep fighting.[N]
See you around, Iberis. Or not.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Grr[Beat] What blatant disrespect![AN]
I'll show him[Beat] I'll show them[N]
all how important I really am![AN][X]

[MidRight][LoadAxel]
Er, Iberis?[N]
Do you[Beat] have a moment?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]What do you want, clod?[AN]
I have nothing to say to you,[N]
and you clearly don't respect me[N]
enough to want to speak to me, either.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ouch, that's harsh[Beat] Well,[N]
I just wanted to say that[N]
I'm sorry about K-[.5] Lord Korovai.[AN]
He was[Beat] Well, I won't pretend[N]
he was perfect, but he seemed[N]
genuine about wanting to help Freyse.[AN]
It's shame he went down this way.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh[Beat] Well, thank you, Axel.[N]
I must admit, I never expected[N]
my cousin to die so suddenly.[AN]
Supposedly, some of the prisoners our[N]
forces held in House Selese's dungeons[N]
escaped, killing him in the Tenet Caves.[AN]
[Beat]But I don't believe that, not a bit.[AN]
[MidRight]
Oh? You don't believe our commanders?[N]
Well, you've never liked 'em,[N]
so I can't say I'm surprised.[AN]
[MidLeft]
This has nothing to do with my bias.[N]
There are just too many discrepancies[N]
in their story about Korovai's death.[AN]
I don't know what really happened,[N]
yet, but mark my words, I will.[AN]
When I do know what happened with[N]
certainty, I'll avenge his death[N]
and lead House Freyse to a new era.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, uh[Beat] Good for you, I guess.[N]
I hope you do figure it out, really.[N]
For now though, we've got a job to do.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Yes, we do. Thank you for listening,[N]
Axel. Please keep this between us.[AN]
[MidRight]
Sure, you got it.[N]
Consider it our secret.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Mm. I'll head back to the front first.[N]
Watch my back, if you wish.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
[Beat]So she doesn't know, huh?[AN]
Kjell must really be a dead[N]
ringer for this Korovai guy,[AN]
if even his cousin can't tell.[AN]
I feel bad, though[Beat] Should[N]
I tell her who he really was?[AN]
But then, how do I explain it?[N]
[Beat]I'll have to think it over.[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadAxel]
[MidLeft]
Axel[Beat] It seems we're deployed[N]
together again, like always.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hey, we make a good pair,[N]
despite our differences.[AN]
Clearly the commanders have[N]
an eye for synergy, eh?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Speaking of them, there's[N]
something I wanted to tell you.[AN]
Do you remember what we talked[N]
about, with regards to Lord Korovai?[AN]
[MidRight]
Sure I do.[N]
What about it?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I did some of my own investigations[N]
into the matter, and from what I saw,[N]
my suspicions are nearly confirmed.[AN]
I only need a bit more evidence,[N]
and I'll have enough to prove them.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
So, you're sayin' that Commander Cleo[N]
lied to us? Why would they do that?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Who knows? Without Korovai around,[N]
and with other Freysian forces[N]
like myself busy carrying on his will,[AN]
it would give them free rein to take[N]
advantage of the vacuum created and[N]
undercut House Freyse's position.[AN]
Either way, I can't claim to know[N]
their motives, but it seems clear[N]
to me that they murdered Korovai.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Then what's your plan?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
For now[Beat] nothing. I don't have all[N]
the evidence I need, and there are[N]
more important things to consider.[AN]
As much as I despise that wretch Cleo,[N]
I can't leave the Liberators just yet,[AN]
not with the catastrophic consequences[N]
if the Liberators fail to stop Cythes.[AN]
Once we're done, though, I'll ensure[N]
that House Freyse retains its position[N]
and avenge my cousin, immediately.[AN]
[MidRight]
You're really going to war, huh?[N]
[Beat]Tell you what. If you need another[N]
fighter by your side, you can hire me.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
What? Axel, why would you do that?[N]
Do you not understand the danger?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Well, I've got my own reasons.[AN]
Let's leave it at that, yeah?[N]
Say, if you're paying me for it,[N]
I can call you [OpenQuote]Lady" like you wanted.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm[Beat] No, that won't be necessary.[N]
It would only sound uncouth coming[N]
from your unrefined voice, Axel.[AN]
I[Beat] appreciate your offer and accept.[AN]
After we're done here, I'll hire you[N]
on as my staff. For now, though,[N]
I see an enemy waiting nearby,[AN]
so we'll have to cut this talk short![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Sorry, Iberis. Maybe it would've[N]
been better for you if I told you[N]
the truth, but as for me[Beat][AN]
I want vengeance too, for my pal.[AN]
Kjell[Beat] I'll make sure this doesn't[N]
go unpunished. For the Jackal Gang![A][X]

[OpenMidRight]Axel! What sort of mischief[N]
are you getting up to?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]I ain't getting up to mischief,[N]
of any sort, chief.[AN]
You'd do well to turn away, now.[N]
Mind your own business![A]
[OpenMidRight]Harrumph! Insolent youths and[N]
their disrespect. We are a team, Axel.[AN]
You can't allow your focus to waver[N]
on the battlefield.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OneLineBox]Listen, Pelican-[A]
[OpenMidRight]Pelecaye.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][TwoLineBox]Pelecaye.[N]
Direct your gaze to the enemy instead.[AN]
I'm on your side! Don't worry about me.[N]
Alright?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Hrm[Beat][A][X]

## Axel_Pelecaye_B

[OpenMidLeft][LoadAxel][OpenMidRight][LoadPelecaye]
[OpenMidRight]Axel! Leave that body alone.[N]
He's already dead.[AN]
Let him take his belongings[N]
to whatever fate he may have.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nagging me again, eh Pelecaye?[N]
He's got no use for these things.[AN]
With a little cleaning, they're as good[N]
as new. We can sell these for food.[AN]
Or better yet, new weapons.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ThreeLineBox]Yes, but there is a time and place[N]
for looting, and it isn't in the employ[N]
of an army, Axel.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Baloney! It's in the chaos of battle[N]
where it's easiest to get up to your[N]
so-called mischief, Pelecaye.[AN]
I bet you'll be thankful we were able[N]
to, as some may say, [OpenQuote]liquidate[N]
their assets", for our own gain![A]
[OpenMidRight]So, this is the tomfoolery you've[N]
been up to. Looting from the dead?[N]
Come now, Axel, focus on the fighting.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Look around, Pelecaye, everyone[N]
is doing it. Looting from the dead is what[N]
we need to do in this business.[AN]
That's how we've gotten this far.[N]
I thought an old coot like you[N]
would know a thing or two about long life.[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]I am not an old coot![N]
I am[Beat] youthful! Vibrant![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright, alright. I didn't[N]
mean to offend.[AN]
It's just[Beat] you always seem so serious.[N]
You never cut loose or have any fun![A]
[OpenMidRight]I know how to have fun![A][N]
Just last night I was reading[N]
about an extinct species of bee.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ThreeLineBox]By yourself? Sounds thrilling.[N]
Look, I am going to do my job.[N]
Stop nagging me, and do yours, alright?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]Am I really so[Beat] joyless?[A][X]

## Axel_Pelecaye_A

[OpenMidRight][OneLineBox]Axel.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Pelecaye? Come to chastise me some more?[A]
[OpenMidRight][TwoLineBox]No, I've come to apologize.[N]
You are right. I am an[Beat] old coot.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Woah, now, you serious?[N]
It was just a jab in jest. A jape![A]
[OpenMidRight]All such japes have a kernel[N]
of truth to them, Axel.[AN]
Truthfully, I've forgotten how to enjoy myself.[N]
I've been so mired in my work[Beat][AN]
I've forgotten how to feel.[N]
I've forgotten joy.[AN]
I want to feel the wind blowing[N]
in my hair once more, Axel![A]
[OpenMidLeft]I, er, don't think I can help[N]
you with that last part, Pelecaye,[AN]
but I can certainly teach you[N]
a thing or two about having a good time.[AN]
You know anything about playing[N]
cards? Gambling?[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're[Beat] inviting me to[N]
play cards with you?[AN]
Axel[Beat] I'm touched.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Woah now, no need to get sappy.[N]
I'm just trying to take your money.[AN]
But I'm sure you'll have a good time[N]
kicking back with me and the lads![A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, that does sound nice.[N]
Even if I lose a few coins.[AN]
Sign me up, Axel.[N]
I look forward to it.[A][X]
