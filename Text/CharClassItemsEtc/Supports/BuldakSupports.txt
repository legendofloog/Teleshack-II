Hey there, name's Faolan.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hello, I'm Buldak.[AN]
[MidRight]
Nice to make your acquaintance.[AN]
Wanted to check up on you,[N]
you always seem down, real sullen.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Thanks for noticing,[AN]
but it's hard to keep[N]
my spirits up,[AN][CloseEyes]
especially with everything[N]
that's happened.[AN][OpenEyes]
[MidRight]
Yeah, there's been a lot of[N]
fightin' and killin',[AN]
but tomorrow's another[N]
day, you know?[AN]
[MidLeft]
How are you in such a good[N]
mood with everything going on?[AN]
[MidRight]
I find it helps to look on[N]
the positive side of things.[AN]
Like, the liberation movement[N]
has been making real progress.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Maybe, but it's far from over,[AN]
and things tend to get worse[N]
before they get better.[AN]
[MidRight]
I suppose so[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
Take care of yourself, Faolan.[N]
Don't get butchered out there.[A][X]

Heyo! Glad to see you, Buldak![AN]
How are you holding[N]
up out here?[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Hey, Faolan. I'm doing okay.[AN]
You seem to be in a[N]
really good mood.[AN]
Moreso than usual.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
How can I not be?[AN]
I'm positively beaming,[N]
still ridin' the excitement[AN]
of kickin' Cythes outta[N]
our home![AN]
It was a lotta fightin'[N]
and strugglin'.[AN]
But things tend to turn[N]
out alright after all![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
I don't agree.[AN]
Things really don't[N]
turn out for the best.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well sure, things don't[N]
always turn out so-[AN]
[MidLeft]
Sometimes good people die[N]
for no good reason, Faolan.[AN]
[CloseEyes]
While scumbags who don't[N]
deserve better walk free.[AN]
[MidRight]
Buldak[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
And then when it's over,[AN]
everyone just forgets[N]
about it and moves on;[AN]
no justice for the dead.[AN]
I don't know how you can[N]
just do that, Faolan.[AN]
[MidRight]
You have to, ya' know?[AN]
It'd be unbearable; you'd[N]
never be able to keep goin'.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Honestly, I don't feel[N]
like I'm better off.[AN]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Hey don't-[N]
Drat.[AN]
Buldak, you poor soul,[N]
carrying that burden.[AN]
It ain't right.[A][X]

[MidRight]
Hey, Buldak. Glad I found ya.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hey. Glad to see you're[N]
still kicking.[AN]
[MidRight]
Same to you.[AN]
Say, I was thinking about[N]
something heavy.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah?[AN]
[MidRight]
All that stuff you said[N]
before got to me.[AN]
You're right though. Things[N]
ain't all so great.[AN]
'specially for the folk we[N]
lost along the way.[AN]
So, I figured,[AN]
when this is all over,[AN]
I'd want to memorialize the[N]
people who died in this mess.[AN]
And I wanna do it back[N]
in your town.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
I don't want people to forget[N]
everyone we lost along the way.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Faolan[Beat][AN]
I think I'll help you with that.[AN]
[MidRight]
I'm glad to hear it, Buldak.[AN]
I'll be there to help[N]
every step of the way,[AN]
just you watch.[A][X]

[MidLeft]
Is that who I think it is?[N]
Lean, keen and mean.[AN]
Big step up from hunting[N]
rabbits, Buldak.[A]
[MidRight]
Valse? It's been a good many years,[N]
heard you joined up with Selese.[A]
[MidLeft]
Didn't work out, but good thing we[N]
don't have to be on opposite sides.[A]
[MidRight]
I'm glad. I remember a few[N]
youngsters enlisted with you.[AN]
How are they doing now?[A]
[MidLeft]
You know how it is. They weren't[N]
as lucky as me, not much to say.[A]
[MidRight]
No doubt due to the commander[N]
treating enlistees like fodder.[A]
[MidLeft]
You never did seem like the kind of[N]
person to voluntarily fight in a war.[A]
[MidRight]
Special circumstances, leave it[N]
at that. What about you, Valse?[AN]
What brought you to the side of[N]
these so-called liberators?[A]
[MidLeft]
You're a braver man than I thought.[N]
As for me, I was convinced to join the[AN]
Liberators by the late Lord Korovai.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I never did trust those shifty noble types[N]
but I knew Lord Korovai was different.[AN]
Unlike most of those cowards, he led from[N]
the front. His weapon acted as his words.[AN]
I hoped a man like him could change Freyse[N]
for the better, but he was taken too soon.[AN]
But enough about me. What about you?[N]
You didn't give me much of an answer.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Another time.[A][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Did I say something wrong?[A][X]


## ValseBuldakBSupport
[MidLeft][LoadValse][MidRight][LoadBuldak]
[MidLeft]
Buldak, did you hear about[N]
what happened to your town?[A]
[MidRight]
I think I have. Not quick[N]
on the uptake, are you?[A]
[MidLeft]
What a senseless tragedy. I hardly believe[N]
Selese would resort to such bloodshed.[AN]
If only Lord Korovai and his forces[N]
arrived sooner to prevent this atrocity.[A]
[MidRight]
That's the story they've told?[N]
The audacity leaves me speechless.[A]
[MidLeft]
So you don't agree with[N]
how they've told it?[A]
[MidRight]
Considering it was this [OpenQuote]Lord" Korovai who[N]
tricked the Liberators into this slaughter,[AN]
for a few bags of rice, I would say that no,[N]
I don't agree with how they've told it.[A]
[MidLeft]
I can't believe this. This very band we've[N]
joined were responsible for the crime?[AN]
And that Lord Korovai had them do it?[AN]
He was an honourable sort,[N]
he wouldn't do such acts.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
How did you reach that conclusion?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
When he spoke of the liberation of Freyse,[N]
he spoke with such passion, such fervour.[AN]
He didn't cower in safety but led from[N]
the front, he laughed and dined with his men.[A]
[MidRight]
He could be both that and a vile villain.[N]
That's how these leaders fool you.[AN]
They pretend to be one with the people,[N]
that they care, that they are like us.[AN]
But when the push comes to shove, they[N]
won't hesitate to throw us into the fire.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Is it not possible you were mistaken?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
No, it is not. Considering I was[N]
present and witnessed what happened.[A]
[MidLeft]
I don't want to believe you, Buldak.[N]
But you have no reason to lie to me.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
It isn't hard to find out for yourself.[A][X]

## ValseBuldakASupport
[MidLeft][LoadValse][MidRight][LoadBuldak]
[MidLeft]
I asked some discrete questions[N]
and I'm not liking the answers.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
What did they tell you?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
What you told me. That the[N]
Liberators had been duped,[N]
thinking the village was an enemy camp.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
They too profited from that battle,[N]
they may be just redirecting the blame.[A]
[MidLeft]
I suppose that is possible, though[N]
I am hopeful that isn't the case.[AN]
But they also said that[Beat] It was you[N]
who led Korovai to your village.[A]
[MidRight]
You want to hear it from my mouth? It's true.[N]
Like you, I believed in Korovai's words once.[AN]
But I cannot blame him for my own foolishness[N]
and avarice. Taking the deal was my fault.[AN]
Easy gold for easy information, and it would[N]
be Mi and the rest who paid the real price.[A]
[MidLeft]
I don't believe you had malicious[N]
intentions. I think you were tricked.[A]
[MidRight]
Why believe me so easily? I too profited[N]
from the battle, given the promised reward.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I can see your anger towards Korovai,[N]
and I feel the sincerity in your words.[A]
[MidRight]
You said the same about Korovai. Perhaps[N]
you aren't a good judge of character.[A]
[MidLeft]
I didn't know Korovai. But I know you,[N]
Buldak, have always been a good man.[AN]
A bit standoffish, a bit greedy,[N]
but a good man.[A]
[MidRight]
We were never even that close before[N]
you left, Valse. But[Beat] thank you.[AN]
Everyone else believes I was in on it[N]
for the gold. But I didn't want this.[A]
[MidLeft]
Though now, knowing the truth[Beat] Korovai[N]
convinced me to join the side of justice.[AN]
Knowing what he, what the Liberators did,[N]
I feel my spear now lacks conviction.[A]
[MidRight]
You were a good fighter, but not a good[N]
soldier. You should never have joined up.[A]
[MidLeft]
Why do you fight, Buldak? You have no[N]
reason to stay, given what they did.[AN]
Are you hoping for a chance at revenge?[A]
[MidRight]
Of course not. What's one man to do?[N]
I certainly can't return home.[AN]
My reputation precedes me, the one[N]
who sold out his village for gold.[AN]
I haven't left because I don't[N]
know where else I should go.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
That's no way to live life.[A]
[MidRight]
A good life isn't something I deserve.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I tell you what. If you ever need[N]
a place to stay, my doors are open.[A]
[MidRight]
You don't want someone with my reputation[N]
around. And we aren't even that close.[A]
[MidLeft]
I owe you one for opening my eyes regarding[N]
Korovai, I could've made some poor decisions.[AN]
Really, it's nothing to help an old friend.[AN]
[MidRight]
I will keep that in mind.[N]
Thank you, Valse.[A][X]

Hey! Long time no see, Buldak.[AN]
It feels like a long, long time since[N]
you left to join the Freyse rebels.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]So you joined the Liberators, Tao.[N]
How are you holding up these days?[N]
I[Beat] I'm sorry, about Mifan.[AN]
I never should've sided with Korovai.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, what's done is done. I know that[N]
you were manipulated by them too,[N]
so the blame's not all on you.[AN]
[MidRight]
Manipulated, huh? Maybe so,[N]
but it was still all my fault.[AN]
Even if they told me that no harm[N]
would come to our village, I should[N]
have known that was a bald-faced lie.[AN]
Why else would the Freysian rebels[N]
be so curious about nearby villages,[N]
flush with food stores to pilfer?[AN]
[Beat]No, they intended to use force[N]
the moment Mifan rejected the request.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I see. Then the Liberators, and even[N]
Korovai himself, couldn't have done a[N]
thing without your info. Is that right?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Yeah. If you want to blame anyone,[N]
then blame me. I deserve that much.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] [Beat][AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Anyway, that's all I have to say there.[AN]
I swore to Commander Cleo that I'd[N]
atone for all the harm I've done,[N]
so that's why I'm still around.[AN]
Speaking of[Beat] We'd better not stay[N]
here long with a battle going on.[N]
Stay safe, Tao.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
Blame you, huh[Beat] Yeah, I think[N]
I'll take you up on that, Buldak.[AN]
If not for you, Mi would still[Beat][A][X]

[Beat]I can hear it. A bowstring's being[N]
drawn back, right in front of me[Beat][N]
Is the day of my death finally here?[AN]
Well, I can't complain after all I've[N]
done[Beat][CloseEyes] Please, just make it quick.[A]
[FarFarLeft][LoadTao][TwoLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
[Beat]Well, what are you waiting[N]
for? Take the shot already.[AN]
[FarFarLeft]
[Beat][A]
[MoveMidLeft][MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
The heck's with that[Beat] I guess[N]
those ears of yours are why[N]
you got hired on as a tracker.[AN]
[MidRight]
Tao? Ah, I see[Beat] You haven't really[N]
forgiven anyone. I thought that story[N]
was too convenient, and I was right.[AN]
It's not so easy to forgive and forget.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]No, it isn't. You told me to blame[N]
you, and with Korovai and his cronies[N]
gone, there's no one else who can be.[AN]
If I don't kill you[Beat] Then Mi[N]
will lie unavenged, forever.[AN]
I can't allow that to happen.[AN]
[MidRight]
If that's the case, then hurry it up.[AN]
One of our allies might come if you[N]
wait too long, wasting your chance.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Why are you so[Beat] Never mind that.[AN]
Tell me, Buldak. What was so worth[N]
it that made you willing to risk[N]
the safety of our friends and family,[AN]
dragging them to an early grave?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Gold, glory, and all that would[N]
give us. Korovai's army paid me well[N]
to track whatever they wanted to find.[AN]
I thought that with the money they gave,[N]
I could buy all that rice back and make[N]
a name for myself throughout Freyse.[AN]
Then, I'd be in a position to make even[N]
more money after Cythes left our borders.[AN]
Enough so that we'd never have to worry[N]
about food again[Beat] And that Mi's[N]
burden would be just a bit lighter.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]So you didn't want those things for[N]
the sake of it? You had an actual goal?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Sure, but what does it matter now?[AN]
Because of me, Mi and everyone else[N]
is dead. No matter how much I atone,[N]
that's never going to go away.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]You're right, Buldak. Redemption[N]
is a lost cause for you, but you[N]
shouldn't atone just because of that.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
You're[Beat] lowering your bow?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I just realized that killing you[N]
wouldn't do any good, either.[AN]
That's the easy way out for you.[N]
Instead, I want you to promise[N]
me something, in Mi's memory.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]Well, then say it.[N]
I'll do whatever I can.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
You and me, we'll rebuild the village[N]
to be even better than it was before.[AN]
There are still people left in Shagahn,[N]
mostly folks who didn't want to fight[N]
and fled when Korovai's army came.[AN]
If we can get some of 'em to settle[N]
back in, and put in the work to restore[N]
the village, I'm sure Mi would be happy.[A]
[MidRight]
That's a tall task, given the state[N]
that Korovai and the Liberators[N]
left it in[Beat] but alright, I promise.[AN]
The ruins of Shagahn[Beat] We'll bring[N]
them back to their former glory![A][X]
