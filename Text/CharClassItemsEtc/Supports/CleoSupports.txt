Neiiiigh![AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Easy, boy. We've got a long fight[N]
ahead of us, and I can't have you[N]
backing out of it just yet.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadCleo][TwoLineBox]
Emil, what was that- Ah, it's just[N]
your horse. He's[Beat] quite loud.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Ha! Yeah, Levert's a talker. My family[N]
made me take him with me when I left[N]
the farm. He's not a warhorse,[AN]
but he gets the job done, at least.[AN]
I just feel bad making him do it.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
You[Beat] feel bad?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Well, I bet Levert never wanted to live[N]
a life on the run as a rebel's horse.[N]
Don't you feel bad for your pegasus?[AN]
[MidRight]
Hm[Beat] perhaps a bit, but I've trained[N]
with her for years. We're partners,[N]
in this venture and any other.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That makes sense, given you're[N]
one of those military types. Still,[N]
I can't shake my guilt over it.[AN]
We're forcing them to risk their[N]
own hides when they should be grazing[N]
wherever they please, y'know?[AN]
[MidRight]
As nice as that would be, so long as[N]
humans do battle, we cannot cast aside[N]
any boon, whether that be steel or steed.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Yeah, I guess. It's just a shame.[N]
Well, we'd better get back to it, eh?[N]

[MidRight][LoadCleo][ThreeLineBox]
Emil? What's the matter?[N]
We still have a battle to win.[N]
You can't wait like a practice dummy.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Huh? Oh, sorry. I was[Beat][N]
thinkin' about something.[N]
It won't happen again, commander.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Well, what's eating at you?[N]
If you mean to fight in this state,[N]
you'll soon find yourself dead.[AN]
It's best you get it off your chest[N]
so that doesn't happen, right?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ah[Beat] Well, if you're willing[N]
to listen, then I'm grateful.[AN]
A little while back, me and Levert[N]
rode near the front and came across[N]
an old pal of mine from the troop.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
A Cythean, then? Did he attack you?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Well[Beat] Not at first, no.[N]
He musta been as shocked as I was,[N]
so we both just watched each other.[AN]
Soon enough though, he shot an arrow[N]
right at me! It was all me and Levert[N]
could do to book it on out of there.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Why didn't you charge?[AN]
[MidLeft]
W-What? How could I? He was too far-[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I know you and your mount, Emil.[AN]
If he was close enough to hit you,[N]
then with your speed, and Levert,[N]
you certainly could've done the same.[AN]
You just[Beat] ran away from the enemy?[N]
One that had just tried to kill you?[AN]
[MidLeft]
But we[Beat] we were pals! We came from[N]
the same village, fought in the same[N]
squad, and risked our lives together![AN]
[MidRight]
That's all very nice, but it doesn't[N]
change that he loosed an arrow at you.[AN]
Our Cythean countrymen don't care[N]
that we once fought at their side.[N]
To them, we're just another enemy.[AN]
Don't forget who we are now, Emil.[N]
Only one road lies before us now[Beat][N]
The path of a liberator and a traitor.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

I can't forget who we were[Beat][AN][X]

Emil[Beat] Your gaze looks sharper.[N]
I see you took my advice to heart.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I came across that old friend again[N]
on the battlefield, Commander Cleo.[N]
He drew his bow right away this time.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
And? How did you defeat him?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I lifted my lance, spurred Levert[N]
to charge, and prayed I'd strike first.[N]
But someone else got him before I did.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat] [Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
An arrow flew right through his neck[Beat][N]
All I saw was a dragon flying away,[N]
so it must've been Commander Loewe.[AN]
Y'know[Beat] I should've been happy,[N]
right? One more enemy down, and[N]
I get to keep my head on my shoulders.[AN]
But all I could do was regret that[N]
things ended this way. That two[N]
countrymen would be forced to do this.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Orfeas is who teared you apart.[N]
If he no longer holds power, then you'll[N]
have no need to fight each other anymore.[AN]
[MidLeft]
And what then? It won't bring back all[N]
of the brothers and sisters we've killed.[AN]
What's even left of Cythes, at[N]
the end of our path of "liberation?"[AN]
[MidRight]
I don't know, but whatever there is,[N]
we can persevere, as long as those of[N]
us who live on rebuild with what remains.[AN]
I intend to help that effort in any way[N]
that I can, so long as I survive.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]Then it looks like the two of us[N]
have a lot of work to do, huh?[AN]
Let me help you, commander.[AN]
[MidRight]
Certainly, I'll take any aid I can,[N]
and you're one of my best soldiers.[N]
What ideas do you have for Cythes?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, there'll still be a lot of[N]
Cythean soldiers left at the end,[N]
yeah? We can't let them do whatever.[AN]
Some of them may still resent us for[N]
what we've done, and they may try to[N]
turn on us even after Orfeas is gone,[AN]
so let's give 'em jobs as recompense.[AN]
[MidRight]
Using the former soldiers as a labor[N]
force[Beat] Yes, that will work nicely.[AN]
We would need to figure out payment,[N]
but I suspect most of them will forget[N]
their grudges with gold in their pocket.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Right. I was thinkin' farm work would[N]
be good, assuming we have enough[N]
good land to till and raise animals on.[AN]
Cythes'll need a steady food source[N]
again, and farming is as good as any.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes, that's wise. I'll leave these[N]
matters to you, Emil, since you've[N]
clearly given it some thought.[AN]
[MidLeft]
H-Huh? I'm not really qualified, though.[N]
Seems more suited to people like you,[N]
the smarter types. I'm just a farmboy.[AN]
[MidRight]
Don't sell yourself short, Emil.[AN]
A "farmboy" can be quite useful, and the[N]
common soldiers will trust you more,[N]
given your background and humility.[AN]
You're the perfect man for the job.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well[Beat] if you say so, commander,[N]
then I'll do it! We'll make sure[N]
that my friend's death[Beat][AN]

deaths weren't for nothing.[AN][X]

Is it true that you're a Cythean?[AN]

And above all, you were one of them![AN]

hunted our game, burned our forests?![AN]

Darby! I have something[N]
to discuss with you.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]What is it, commander?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You mentioned your distrust of Cytheans,[N]
quite a while back. First, I want to[N]
assure you, I understand your feelings.[AN]
Many Decians share your view on the[N]
matter, and I cannot blame them.[AN]
As a hunter, you above all must keenly[N]
feel the loss of Decia's forests at[N]
the hands of overzealous occupiers.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]That I do. Fresh game used to be[N]
plentiful in Freyse. My mother taught[N]
me everything I know about the hunt[Beat][AN]
And now, it's difficult to even find[N]
the animals she described.[AN]
[MidRight]
Indeed, our forces gorged on the[N]
animals found in Decia, especially[N]
when we lacked food ourselves.[AN]
[Beat]That's why the war began, after all.[AN]
Maintaining a nation of Cythes's size[N]
required food, and our lost blessing[Beat][N]
It took everything we had away.[AN]
[MidLeft]
So? Am I supposed to feel bad for you,[N]
when Decia is in the same situation[N]
because you lot invaded our home?[AN]
[MidRight]
No, you can feel however you like.[AN]
But if you were in our boots,[N]
if your survival depended on it,[N]
what would you have done differently?[AN]
[MidLeft]
If Decia's forests were at risk[Beat][N]
If my way of life disappeared[Beat][N]
I don't know what I would do.[AN]
[Beat]I see your point, but when Cythes[N]
is cowed, they'll still have nothing.[N]
How do you plan to fix that?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Well, it's a big job. I'll need ample[N]
support, and it will take many, many[N]
years to regain what we once had.[AN]
Forests aren't exactly my area of[N]
expertise, or the proper hunting[N]
regulations[Beat] It's a challenge, but-[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
No need to say it, boss.[N]
I'll help you out![AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I would greatly appreciate[N]
your knowledge in this field,[N]

I'm not needed in Decia, but given[N]
how out of sorts Cythes is, and the[N]

other reasons for why a man like you would[N]

wrong, but[Beat][A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Heh. Glad to see working with this raggedy[N]

It's as you surmised. I was disillusioned with[N]

I can see why you left the Cythean army,[N]

If you believed it to be a wrong path, why[N]

[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]At first it was simply a convenient[N]
path out.[AN]
Your father offered a great sum to[N]

became difficult.[AN]
[Beat]At any rate, I've answered your question.[N]
Are you satisfied with my loyalties?[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Right. Yes.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][MoveLeft][ThreeLineBox]
He was definitely hiding something[Beat][N]
but is it worth prying? I've known him most[N]
of my life, yet know so little about him[Beat][A][X]

Varga.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Yes?[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
About our last conversation[Beat][N]
I had[Beat]another question.[A]
[MidLeft]
Well, then. What is it?[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
It's not related to this army per se, but[Beat][A]
[MidLeft]
Then I don't see any point in asking it.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
I think it's important. Why did[N]
you stay on as my and Elias's tutor?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I answered this. Because it was a[N]
convenient way out.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I asked why you stayed on, not[N]
why you took the post in the[N]
first place.[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat]I don't know what you're[N]
driving at.[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
If that's truly the case, then[N]
I'll accept that answer, and[N]
won't bother you further.[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Well?[A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[CloseEyes]
[Beat]
You really aren't the same girl you[N]
used to be.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
Is that all-[A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[OpenEyes]I had a son.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]What?[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
His name was Lyuben. He was[Beat][N]
a stubborn kid. He and I always[N]
used to argue[Beat][AN]
But I was always proud of him.[N]
My wife and I, we raised him to[N]
love Cythes, to embody all of its ideals.[AN]
She and I were both in the army,[N]
and we saw to it that he followed[N]
in our footsteps. And he did.[AN]
He was a fine soldier. He lived[N]
for our country[Beat][N]
and he died for it.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I[Beat]I'm so sorry. I never knew.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]After Lyuben died,[N]
I saw my faith in all I believed in[N]
collapse.[AN]
What use was glory or honor to[N]
my son's rotting corpse?[AN]
There were plenty of honeyed words[N]
bandied about after he died, but[N]
none gave me any succor.[AN]
I could never again wield my sword[N]
without it being held back by the[N]
emptiness of my purpose.[AN]
And my wife, she was a Cythean through[N]
and through. She couldn't understand,[N]
and it's what drove us apart.[AN]
I was well and truly alone. I reached[N]
for any path out of that darkness,[N]
and it led me to you.[A]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
As I said before, I truly only intended for[N]
it to be a temporary role. But I saw too[N]
much of Lyuben in you.[AN]
Before I knew it[Beat]I grew attached.[AN]
I kept telling myself, [OpenQuote]now wasn't a good[N]
time to abandon your training", and so,[N]
months became years.[AN]
Of course this was beyond selfish, and[N]
I despised myself for it, and for my inability[N]
to move on.[AN]
Here I was, raising another innocent soul[N]
for the warrior's pyre. I tried to ease my[N]
conscience in some small ways, but[Beat][A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Everything you taught me that was against[N]
the Cythean doctrine[Beat][A]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
I know it was nothing but assuaging[N]
my-[A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
No. I'm glad you were my tutor. Without[N]
those holes you made in my worldview, I[N]
would have been a Cythean to the end.[AN]
There would have been nothing for[N]
Dragana to salvage in me. I really am[Beat][N]
grateful for that.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]
When I heard you joined the Liberators,[N]
I was both joyful and saddened. Happy[N]
that you had found a better path.[AN]
Dismayed that I was still such a coward.[N]
I had to be offered the position by Elias, to[N]
leave as I had wished all those years.[A]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
Betraying your homeland[Beat]is no small feat.[N]
I can't be too angry at you about that. [A]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Varga, I[Beat] You've been more of a father[N]
to me than my actual one. I was ecstatic[N]
when I realized I wouldn't have to fight you.[A]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Thank you, Cleo. I've blundered so much[N]
in this life, but[Beat]seeing the woman you've[N]
become[Beat]I've done one thing right, at least.[A]
