Hm[Beat] So that's how you do it?[N]
I'll have to keep that in mind.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadEmil][ThreeLineBox]
Iskra? The heck are you doing,[N]
reading a book with enemies right[N]
by us! You want to die or something?[AN]
[MidLeft]
This isn't just any book, Emil.[AN]
It's a tome that's got all sorts[N]
of neat spells that I'm using.[AN]
See these runes here? They're not[N]
the common Orodrethian language[N]
that everyone uses today.[AN]
In fact, it's written in an ancient[N]
script that Decians used before Cythes[N]
grew into the empire we know today.[AN]
[MidRight]
Er, that's nice and all, but you[N]
still got your nose in a book.[AN]
Captain Mira always told me to keep[N]
my eyes on the enemy in front of me,[N]
so you should do that too, Iskra.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Please, I'm not so simple-minded[N]
that I can't recite a chant and[N]
keep track of who's in front of me.[AN]
Besides, I nearly know them by heart[N]
now, so I rarely read them as is.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well, fair enough. I guess I looked[N]
at it like if it was me, but you're[N]
a heck of a lot smarter than I am.[AN]
I can barely read regular letters,[N]
so you're real impressive to me![AN]
Oh, looks like there's a soldier[N]
over there, so that's our cue.[AN]
Follow my lead, Iskra![AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Wait, what?[A] Emil can't read?[AN]
I knew that he wasn't exactly[N]
well-educated, but this[Beat][N][CloseEyes]
What kind of scout can't read a sign?[N][OpenEyes]
Something has to be done about this![AN][X]

[MidRight][LoadEmil]
Iskra? What'd you come over here for?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Emil[Beat] Do you really not know?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Hm[Beat] Is this about the baklava?[AN]
I mean, I know I ate a lot,[N]
but you said it was okay, so-[AN]
[MidLeft]
Emil, I'm not going to strike up[N]
a conversation about pastries[N]
with enemies staring us down,[AN]
no matter how tasty they may be[N]
or how much of a pig you are.[AN]
[MidRight]
You do sound a little mad about it[Beat][N]
Well, then what's that look about?[AN]
You already know I'm not that smart,[N]
so don't expect me to read your mind.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Reading is the problem here, Emil![AN]
Specifically, you not being able[N]
to do it! I didn't notice at first,[AN]
but there are so many things that[N]
you can't do for us as a result.[AN]
For one, how do you properly plan[N]
routes for the army if you[N]
can't even read a map? Hm?[AN]
[MidRight]
Hey, I grew up on a farm, so we didn't[N]
need to study, and we couldn't afford it![AN]
I've been trying to learn ever since[N]
I joined the army, but it's tough stuff.[AN]
After a while here, Captain Mira[N]
said she'd handle all of that,[N]
and I could just do what I do best.[AN]
Riding around, spotting danger,[N]
and running back, I'm good at that,[N]
better than you or anyone else![AN]
If you wanna talk about weaknesses,[N]
what about you? You can barely ride[N]
a mount. Isn't that bad for a scout?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat] Fine, you have a point.[AN]
I just don't think we should give up[N]
on improving ourselves and our skills,[N]
you know? And you're not dumb, either.[AN]
I know you can figure it out if you[N]
work hard and stick with it, Emil.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Alright, Iskra. If you help me get[N]
better at reading, then I'll show you[N]
a thing or two about horseback riding.[AN]
They're both pretty useful skills,[N]
I reckon, even after Cythes falls.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Sounds good to me, Emil.[N]
Let's do our best![AN][X]

[MidRight][ToggleSmile][ThreeLineBox]
Hey, Iskra! That book learning of yours[N]
actually did me some good, after all.[AN]
Can't say I'm ready to read some of the[N]
tomes you've always got your nose in,[N]
but writing letters is pretty useful![AN]
The commanders seem real pleased now,[N]
since I can scratch out notes to pass[N]
on to other scouts and deliver 'em.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yes, "scratch" is an accurate way[N]
of putting it[Beat] Regardless, it's[N]
legible at least, which is enough.[AN]
You've made incredible progress[N]
in such a short time, Emil.[AN]
I can't commend you enough.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ah, shucks. You're doing great too![AN]
I never thought you'd get that good[N]
at horseback riding this quick,[N]
but you're not far behind me now.[AN]
Looks like you can finally keep up![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ha, I wouldn't quite say that, but[N]
thank you anyway. Your lessons were[N]
more valuable than even I hoped.[AN]
I never truly realized how valuable[N]
a horse is on the battlefield[Beat][N]
But now, it's clear as day.[AN]
Why doesn't everyone ride horses[N]
if they're this useful in battle?[AN]
[MidRight]
Heh, that's what I've always wondered,[N]
but I guess they just don't get it.[AN]
[Beat]Anyway, I can't wait to show off[N]
my new skills to my family back home.[AN]
We never needed to read on the farm,[N]
but now that I get it, it's way[N]
more useful than I thought![AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ah, right[Beat] You'll go back to Cythes[N]
when everything's over, right?[AN]
I'd almost forgotten, but[Beat][N]
I suppose we won't see each other much[N]
after the Liberators disband for good.[AN]
It's a shame. Despite any of our[Beat][N]
disagreements, we got along well.[AN]
There aren't many other people around[N]
our age in the Liberators, so it was[N]
nice to have a[Beat] a friend like you.[AN]
[MidRight]
Why are you acting like this is the end?[N]
We both can ride a horse real well, so[N]
why not take turns visiting each other?[AN][ToggleSmile]
My family lives close to the border,[N]
so it's not even that far a trip![AN]
A few weeks, or so[Beat] Probably.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hm[Beat] Well, it isn't an impossible trek.[N]
Ah, that's right! We can write letters[N]
to keep up, even if we're far away.[AN]
[MidRight]
Mm, sounds good. Though, it'd be nice[N]
to live closer to Decia to make seeing[N]
you easier[Beat] You and everyone, I mean![AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I wouldn't mind that, but for now,[N]
let's work on your writing skills.[AN]
We'll have to if I'm meant to read[N]
much of anything outside of scouting[N]
instructions with any accuracy[Beat][A][X]

Iskra? Why did you stop here,[N]
in the middle of our march?[AN]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
[Beat]Oh, Tiberius. It's nothing.[N]
I've just got a lot on my mind.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Is that so? Well, I know the two[N]
of us aren't particularly close,[N]
but feel free to vent, if you wish.[AN]
House Selese may no longer have real[N]
power, but I am a noble, all the same.[N]
It is my duty to support our subjects.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Subject?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Well, yes. You are a Selesian, correct?[AN]
I saw you after the attack on Castle[N]
Selese, and you seemed[Beat] reticent.[AN]
[MidLeft]
And? Isn't that a normal reaction after[N]
seeing the horrors that happened there?[N]
I mean, General Dragana[Beat] She[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I apologize, on behalf of my uncle.[AN]
He became more and more manic after[N]
you Liberators escaped from his grip[Beat][N]
It was only a matter of time until-[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Shut up.[AN]
[MidRight]
Excuse me?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I don't care about your empty apologies,[N]
or your damned uncle. House Selese holds[N]
no power now, and I couldn't be happier.[AN]
It's a miracle that Loewe and Cleo[N]
even decided to spare you, so let's[N]
not pretend that we're comrades.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
Well, that was sudden. I must have[N]
offended her in some way, but[Beat][N]
Why? I don't understand at all.[AN]
I thought my uncle was nothing but kind[N]
to his subjects[Beat] Was I wrong?[A][X]

[Beat]What do you want? I thought I made[N]
it clear that I want nothing to do[N]
with you, Tiberius. Take a hint.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes, your venom was plain to see,[N]
but I could not understand it[N]
until I thought on it some more.[AN]
First off, I'm sorry. Truly.[AN]
I was far too presumptuous,[N]
calling you one of our [OpenQuote]subjects."[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, you weren't wrong that I'm from[N]
Selese. Both my parents lived there.[AN]
But I was raised on Elmhurst Island,[N]
the stronghold of the Decian Liberators,[N]
after my mother took me and fled.[AN]
[MidRight]
Mm, that does make sense. I suppose[N]
your mother must have opposed my[N]
uncle's acquiescence to Cythes.[AN]
[Beat]What of your father, then?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]He didn't feel the same as her,[N]
so he stayed behind in Selese.[N]
For what? He's dead and gone now.[AN]
[MidRight]
I'm[Beat] I'm sorry to hear that, Iskra.[N]
How did he die, if I may pry?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]From his own pride and foolishness.[AN]
He was vain enough to believe that[N]
bending the knee would be enough[N]
to protect his family and people.[AN]
But all he did was bring Decia to[N]
ruin, and leave us to pick up the pieces.[AN]
[MidRight]
Er, Iskra? What are you implying?[AN]
No man in Selese could have that[N]
kind of power[Beat] except[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Forget it. Like I said, I want[N]
nothing to do with House Selese.[N]
Whether that be you, or him.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]

[Beat]Tiberius, how many times do I have[N]
to tell you to go away? If you won't[N]
stop, then I'll just have to tell Loewe-[AN]
[MidRight]
Please, just wait! This is the last time[N]
I'll pester you, I promise you that.[N]
Just[Beat] hear me out, will you?[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Fine, just make it quick.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Very well. You said that you wanted[N]
nothing to do with House Selese.[AN]
I understand that, given what your[Beat][N]
what my uncle has done, Iskra.[N]
But I[Beat] I also feel the same.[AN]
My nobility was once a source of pride,[N]
but now, I can only feel shame when I[N]
think of all the harm we've caused.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]If you get that, then what's the[N]
problem? We have no connection,[N]
except through House Selese.[AN]
[MidRight]
Because[Beat] family should stick together.[N]
At least, that's what my mother says.[AN]
She raised me alone, you see, after my[N]
father disappeared, and my uncle was[N]
always distracted with his work.[AN]
Due to my station, I struggled to make[N]
friends, so she was all that I had.[N]
To me, family is everything, Iskra.[AN]
Is it[Beat] not the same for you?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]No, it is. Mom was the only[N]
blood relative I had, true, but the[N]
Liberators were like a family to me.[AN]
I didn't feel like I was missing[N]
anything, with them all around.[AN]
The newer members are a bit different,[N]
but Loewe, Dragana, Boro, Trajan[Beat][N]
All of them are important to me.[AN]
[MidRight]
I[Beat] I see. Then I suppose I was[N]
mistaken. All we have is our blood[N]
ties, so I can't imagine I stack up.[AN]
I[Beat] I'll leave you alone, then.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat]Hold on a second.[AN]
[MidRight]
Hm?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
It's true that I don't know you all[N]
that well yet, and that you're kinda[N]
stuffy[Beat] but I don't hate you, alright?[AN]
You seem like an alright guy, and[N]
if House Selese is dissolving, then[N]
I've got no reason to push you away.[AN]
After the war's over, we should keep[N]
in touch. I'd[Beat] like to meet my aunt,[N]
some time. Whenever you're ready.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
O-Of course! I'll arrange it[N]
as soon as I can, Iskra![AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Good. But for now, let's focus[N]
on surviving to the very end![A][X]
