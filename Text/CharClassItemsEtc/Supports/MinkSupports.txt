Hello there! You must be The Augur,[N]
famed bringer of omens.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove](Hmph, another one.)[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
It is as you say, I am she who[N]
peers beyond the veil of fate.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Excellent, my name is Mink,[N]
I have a request for you.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove](Bah, here we go again...)[ToggleMouthMove][AN]
With you, I see the warmth of[N]
the sun and chill of a glacier.[AN]
[MidRight]
Huh?[AN]
[MidLeft]
The wisdom you carry will[N]
be passed along thr-[AN]
[MidRight][MidBlink][ToggleSmile]
You know, for someone who can[N]
see into the future,[AN]
you sure are bad at predicting[N]
what I was actually going to ask.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Hmm?[AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]
I wasn't going to ask for you[N]
to tell my fortune,[AN]
I was actually more interested[N]
in learning more about you.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Wait, really?[AN]
[MidRight]
If you'd be willing to indulge[N]
me of course.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Why[Beat] of course![AN]
[MidRight]
Excellent![AN]
The battle seems to be picking up,[N]
so let us reconvene soon.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yes, I look forward to[N]
our next meeting![AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
Oh, what a splend opportunity this will be![AN]
To learn more of Mahemen history directly[N]
from such an influential figure![A][X]

[MidRight]
[Beat]so what are your thoughts[N]
on the Kekepania Revolt?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Bah, that was a terrible day.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveRight]
[Right]
Yes?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Our family meal that we had[N]
been looking foward to[AN]
was completely ruined[N]
by sheer incompetence![AN]
[Right][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight]
I[Beat] see.[AN]
[MidLeft]
We had been saving for months[N]
to import a Chouwoujian Boar,[AN]
you should've seen it,[N]
it was beautiful![AN]
And what does cousin Burkhard,[AN]
curse his name,[A] what does he do?[AN]
He drowns the poor thing in salt![N]
Absolutely ruins it!!![AN]
[MidRight]
Mhm-hm.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I tell you, I told them all.[AN]
[OpenQuote]Keep that cretin Burkhard[N]
away lest he ruins the meal."[AN]
And somehow, they still let him[N]
come to other gatherings![AN]
Bah, no one listens to me.[AN]
[MidRight]
Well then[Beat][AN]
How about the Kalei movement?[AN]
What was life like before[N]
and after it?[AN]
[MidLeft]
That was when my brother[N]
got married![AN]
[MidRight][MidBlink]
I[Beat] imagine that was[N]
a happy time for you all.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Oh, he picked a great woman,[N]
she was the sweetest thing![AN]
And, a great weaver at that![AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
She made the most wonderful[N]
clothing![A] It looked great[N]
and helped keep us cool![AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
Well[Beat][AN]
What about the earthquake that[N]
decimated the city of Nani?[AN]
You were instrumental in[N]
preventing the deaths[N]
of thousands, were you not?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][AN]
Oh yes![A] During that time[N]
I remember meeting a cute[N]
child who drew the most ador-[AN]
[MidRight]
Look. These stories are neat and all,[N]
but could you please focus on[N]
the events I'm asking about?[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveLeft][OneLineBox]
Hold your tongue![AN]
[MidRight]
What?[AN]
[Left][TwoLineBox]
It's always the same thing![AN]
You aren't interested to learn[N]
a damn thing about me at all![AN]
I was only just some way for you[N]
to get what you wanted,[AN]
just like everyone else![AN]
No, with you it was worse;[AN]
you had the audacity to make me[N]
believe for once that someone cared.[AN]
To feel that false hope.[AN]
[MidRight]
I[Beat][AN]
[Left][MoveMidLeft]
Stay away from me,[A] never[N]
speak to me again.[AN][ClearFace]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
[Beat]what have I done?[A][X]

[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Finally! A window of time[N]
to speak to you again.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Still you choose to close your[N]
ears to my words.[AN]
Never again did I wish[N]
to speak with you.[AN]
[MidRight]
You might have the power[N]
to glimpse the future,[AN]
but I know you don't know[N]
what I have to say to you.[AN]
You wouldn't continue to[N]
avoid me if you did![AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I need not future sight[N]
to see you for the cold[N]
serpent you are![AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox][CloseEyes]
Look[Beat] please hear me out,[N]
just this one last time ok?[AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes][MoveRight]
[Right]
Please![AN]
[MidLeft]
Get on with it and speak the[N]
empty words you've brewed.[AN]
[Right][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
You were right, I didn't seek[N]
you out for your sake;[AN]
I really did only care about[N]
the history of Mahemen itself.[AN]
I also didn't realize the burden[N]
that you've had to live with.[AN]
For all my learnedness, I never[N]
bothered to learn about the actual[N]
person who had to endure this firsthand.[AN]
Worse still, any small signs I did[N]
find of your turmoil, I brushed off.[AN]
So[Beat][AN]
I'm through with it.[N]
I'm done talking to you just[N]
to learn the history of Mahamen.[AN]
Never again will I use you[N]
as a means to an end.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[Beat][AN]
I appreciate your honesty.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][ThreeLineBox]
With all that said,[N]
I would like to start over[AN]
and truly become your friend.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox][ToggleSmile]
Bah, all that apologizing, only[N]
to try your scheme again?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
As much of a burden your[N]
future sight has been,[AN]
surely it can reveal the[N]
truth of my intentions.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat][AN]
[Beat]the warmth of the sun[N]
and[Beat][A] a thawing glacier[Beat][AN]
[Beat][Beat]I'll give you a chance.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Thank you.[AN]
Then, let us start at the beginning.[AN]
I want to know what your name is.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]you know me to be the Augur.[A]
[MidRight]
No, I mean your actual name.[AN][ToggleSmile]
I certainly hope that "The" isn't[N]
your first name after all.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
I'm sorry, I hope I wasn't[N]
out of line again.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][A]it's been so long since[N]
someone actually asked that.[AN]
[Beat]Reinhilde[Beat] my name is Reinhilde.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][OpenEyes]
Reinhilde[Beat] what a lovely name.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I have something to show you.[AN]

A drawing?[N]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Ah! What an adorable dog![AN]

[FarFarRight][LoadMink][ToggleSmile][ThreeLineBox]
My my, elder magic?[A] And[N]
powerful ones at that?[AN]
I suppose a font of knowledge like[N]
you would end up being a disciple[N]
of Cherne after all.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Show yourself.[AN]
[FarFarRight][MoveMidRight]
Just a little rat scurrying[N]
about, don't mind me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ah, Mink.[AN]
You do know I employ you[N]
to keep tabs on OTHER people?[AN]
[MidRight]
I wouldn't mark checking up on[N]
a friend under espionage.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Hmph, a wonder why I deal with you.[AN]
Especially after your sloppy work[N]
with handling the incident at[N]
Cidor's manse.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][OneLineBox]
Excuse me, sloppy?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
You got me into a lot of[N]
trouble you know,[AN]
It didn't occur to you to[N]
keep quiet about our arrangement?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][ThreeLineBox]
Kwame, I'm going to be blunt;[AN]
I'm good at reading people,[A] gathering[N]
information,[A] and the occasional[N]
sabotage if I'm feeling frisky.[AN]
[MidBlink]
I'm NOT good at peering into[N]
the literal future and seeing[N]
how events will unfold;[AN]
[ToggleSmile][OpenEyes]
that commander would go[N]
through the trauma of fighting[N]
his reanimated mother,[AN]
or that he'd go on an angst[N]
rampage on the first person[N]
that looked at him funny.[AN]
More poignantly, there shouldn't[N]
have been any issue with what I[N]
revealed in the first place![AN]
[ToggleSmile][MidBlink]
Personally, I'd be thrilled[MidRight][MoveMidRight] to[N]
have someone like me keeping[N]
an eye out for me from the shadows.[AN]
[ToggleSmile][OpenEyes]
Your tendancy to be cryptic over[N]
the tiniest details certainly[N]
doesn't make you any friends.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
How I choose conduct myself[N]
is my own business Mink.[AN]
[MidRight]
I'm saying this for your own[N]
good, not mine, Kwame.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]Anyway[Beat][AN]
While we are on the topic of[N]
that day, you owe me one.[AN]
[OpenQuote]Sloppy" or not,[AN]
Things certainly would've been[N]
a lot worse if I faltered.[AN]
I want payment.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hmph, how do you want to be[N]
compensated this time?[AN]
[MidRight]
History lesson.[AN]
The army has been providing[N]
for me well, so for once[AN]
I don't have to choose whether[N]
to sate my intellectual appitite[AN]
or my physical one.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Very well.[A] I'm feeling generous,[AN]
so I'll be sure to have something[N]
you'll find particularly interesting[N]
when next we meet.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
I'll hold you to it Kwame.[A][X]


## MinkKwame_B
[MidLeft][LoadKwame]
[MidRight][LoadMink][ToggleSmile]
Ah, Kwame, just the person[N]
I was looking for![AN]
[MidRight][MoveRight][ToggleSmile]
Payment.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Hah, wasting no time are you?[AN]
[Right][MoveMidRight]
[MidLeft]
Mink, are you familiar with[N]
The Oath of a Sage?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][MidBlink]
You may have asked what color the[N]
sky is.[A] I thought you said you'd[N]
return with something interesting.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Now now, I asked a simple question.[N]
One that you could easily answer, no?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox][OpenEyes]
Cythes. Fourth century after the[N]
reclaimation wars.[AN]
The emperor's advisor, Sage Loukas,[N]
weaves a great spell of flame,[AN]
setting fire to the imperial palace.[AN]
The fire spreads throughout the[N]
city and countless people die.[AN]
In the wake of the event,[N]
The Oath of the Sage is created;[AN]
a doctrine that formalizes the[N]
responsibilities of those who[N]
dabble in the arcane arts,[AN]
that they respect and fear[N]
the forces that they work with.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Very good, I can see why you were[N]
so bored by my question.[AN]
Now, what kind of person was he?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Hmm?[A] All accounts generally paint[N]
him as a deranged madman at best.[AN]
He's as far from controversial as one[N]
can get;[A] everyone is united in[N]
disdain for the man.[AN][MidBlink][ToggleSmile]
Well, except misanthropes perhaps.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Another question that answers itself.[AN]
However, have you ever taken a look[N]
at academic records from the time?[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile][OpenEyes]
I[Beat] actually can't say that I have.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I can't blame you. It's a bit obscure[N]
and somewhat gatekept knowledge.[AN]
But it does have some interesting[N]
information if you know where to look.[AN]
Curiously, there actually do exist[N]
records for Loukas himself.[AN]
[MidRight]
Not too surprising, the man[N]
did practice magics after all.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Curious still, the idea of the[N]
Oath actually appears well[N]
before the incident.[AN]
[MidRight][MoveRight][ToggleSmile][OneLineBox]
Do tell.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Penned by Loukas no less.[AN]
[Right][ToggleSmile]
You're joking.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
I can show you where in Gechrysos[N]
I found this knowledge[N]
when things settle down.[AN]
But that's not the point,[AN]
the point is that there is a[N]
surprising amount of writing[N]
from Loukas himself.[AN]
Writings, that time and time[N]
again speak of ethics and what[N]
a scholar owes to their fellow man.[AN]
But towards the very tail end,[N]
his writing suddenly becomes[N]
unhinged.[A] Paranoid even.[AN]
[Right][OneLineBox]
[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
They ultimately end[N]
with a manifesto.[AN]
One that claims that he[N]
will do what he must;[AN]
that he will end some unnamed[N]
scourge regardless of cost.[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]this is rather out there[N]
I must admit.[AN]
[MidLeft]
As I said, I'll show my work[N]
when this war is over.[AN]
But for now, your assignment is[N]
to dwell on this tale[AN]
and draw your own meaning[N]
from it.[AN]
[Right][OneLineBox]
I certainly will, Kwame.[A][X]

Kwame.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Ah, my favorite little ratling.[AN]
What brings you scurring out[N]
of the woodworks this time?[AN]
[MidRight]
I'm not here to be coy[N]
with you this time.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
Hmm?[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
There's been a lot on my[N]
mind since we last spoke.[AN]
I had thought about what kind[N]
of man Loukas might have been.[AN]
The posibility that there was more[N]
to him, that he had been changed.[AN]
And then something returns[N]
to the forefront of my mind.[AN]
That night.[AN]
That one night at Cidor's manse.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
You and Cidor were together[N]
for some time,[AN]
before he went mad and all.[AN]
[Beat]he certainly wasn't[N]
a saint to put it lightly.[AN]
But his actions that evening[N]
were extreme, even for him.[AN]
Extreme,[A] and abrupt.[AN]
[Beat][A]Kwame[Beat][AN]
Just what did you two discuss?[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
Kwame?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Truthfully, I hadn't attempted[N]
to make such a connection.[AN]
But now that you bring it up,[N]
it's a perfect parallel I feel.[AN]
They were both men who felt[N]
very strongly about ethics.[AN]
And both were broken by[N]
something they found.[AN]
[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Heh, so there was a bit more[N]
to the Loukas tale th-[AN][ToggleSmile]
Wait[Beat] [OpenQuote]Both".[AN]
[MidLeft]
Mink.[A] Would you like to[N]
know what I said to him that night?[AN]
The knowledge that broke Duke Cidor?[AN]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
[Beat][Beat][AN]
I'm not afraid.[AN]
[OpenEyes]Tell me.[AN]
[MidLeft]
The truth.[AN]
Nothing more than the truth of[N]
things as you and I know;[AN]
I spoke of Cythes's plight and[N]
how they never intended to honor[N]
their promise to spare Decia.[AN]
Of legendary heros, of a founding[N]
father of Decia herself,[AN]
who traded countless lives in[N]
an attempt to live forever.[AN]
And the toll their greed[N]
takes on our world.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
That's all?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
[OpenQuote]That's all?"[A] Ha![AN]
I suppose that exposes the gulf[N]
between you and him as people.[AN]
He was unprepared for the[N]
knowledge he sought out,[AN]
yet sought it he did.[AN]
He had no respect for[N]
what he was dealing with.[AN]
That night exposed Cidor for[N]
weakling that he was.[AN]
[MidRight]
This is[Beat] uncharacteristically[N]
blunt of you.[A] Blunt,[A] and cold.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I feel quite strongly about this Mink.[AN]
The pursuit of knowledge is sacred.[AN]
You of all people would know.[AN]
You embody the spirit[N]
of learning wonderfully.[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
You seek the truth of things,[N]
without fear of what may await.[AN]
Even forgoing base worldly pleasures[N]
like food in your pursuit,[AN]
and when exposed to the truth,[N]
you do not wilt; you grow.[AN]
And this why I share with[N]
you Mink;[A] I respect you.[AN]
[MidRight]
I[Beat] don't know[N]
what to say.[AN]
Thank you?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
Ha. Modest through it all.[AN]
[Beat][AN]
I'm looking forward to seeing[N]
what meaning you'll derive[N]
in end from this war.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
You and me both Kwame.[AN]
You and me both[Beat][A][X]
