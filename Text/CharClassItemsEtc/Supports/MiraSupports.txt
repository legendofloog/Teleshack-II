Iskra, the way ahead is safe,[N]
so you can stop hiding now.[AN]

I[Beat] I'm not scared, alright?[AN]
It's just good to be safe.[AN]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile][ThreeLineBox]
Heh, there's no need to act brave.[AN]
I'd do the same if I were you.[N][ToggleSmile]
We've lost too many fine people[N]
to approach our enemies recklessly.[AN]
[MidRight][CloseEyes]
Mm[Beat] Like General Dragana.[AN]
I keep thinking, what if one of us[N]
had warned her before the attack?[AN]
Could we have saved her?[AN]
[MidLeft]
I've wondered the same,[N]
Iskra. If only I was faster,[N]
if only I took the hit instead[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][OpenEyes]
Mom![A] Don't talk like that. I mean,[N]
the general's death was a big blow,[N]
but if I lost you instead, I[Beat][AN]
I don't know what I would do.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I understand your feelings, I do,[N]
but even so, I would've done it.[AN]
It was my duty[Beat] and I failed.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Hey, Mom. Do you remember that time[N]
when you had General Dragana watch me[N]
and Loewe while you were on a mission?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Hm[Beat] no, I don't remember it well.[AN]
Why do you ask, Iskra?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I never really understood all you did,[N]
but I knew it was really dangerous.[AN]
You were gone all the time, too.[N]
So I asked her a question back then.[N]
[Beat] [OpenQuote]Will my mom come back?"[AN]
Do you know what she said to me?[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseEyes][OneLineBox]
[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
She said that she would never send[N]
you on a job that you couldn't finish.[AN]
That she would never leave a[N]

[Beat]She wouldn't have wanted[N]
you to take that blow, Mom.[N]
So[Beat] don't blame yourself.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat][OpenEyes]You're right, of course.[N]
Still, I needed to hear that.[AN]
No matter how many what-ifs we ask,[N]
it doesn't change what happened.[N]
We can only move forward.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveFarFarRight]

Iskra? We need to keep moving,[N]
so why are you stopped here?[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]Huh? Oh, sorry.[AN]
It's just[Beat] I've been[N]
thinking about something.[AN]
[MidRight][TwoLineBox]
What is it?[N]
You can tell me anything.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]I overheard you and Cidor talking.[AN]
You said that if I ever wanted to know[N]
who my father was, I could ask.[AN]
So is he[Beat] is that man my father?[AN]
[MidRight][OneLineBox]
[Beat]He is.[AN]
[MidLeft][ThreeLineBox]
[Beat]How did you even fall for him, Mom?[AN]
A man cruel enough to kill the general[N]
couldn't possibly be a good person![AN]
[MidRight]
He did that because he believed[N]
appeasing Cythes was all he could do[N]
to maintain what freedom Decia had.[AN]
Cidor was always most concerned with his[N]
subjects. If an empire came knocking at[N]
your door, what would you do, Iskra?[AN]
With an entire barony of people to[N]
protect, would you fight back,[N]
knowing it could mean their deaths?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Of course I would! Cythes took so[N]
much from us[Beat] You're saying it[N]
was right for Cidor to bend the knee?[AN]
Like a coward?! Like a traitor?![AN]
[MidRight]
No![A] That's why I left, Iskra.[AN]
I couldn't agree with his decision.[N]
But before Cythes forced his[N]
hand, Cidor was a good man.[AN]
He was so warm and gentle[Beat][N]
He treated no one, no matter their[N]
station, as if they were unworthy.[AN]
[Beat]And he loved you more than anything.[AN]
[MidLeft][OneLineBox]
[Beat] [Beat][AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
But that love wasn't enough to sway him[N]
from his duty. I warned him, you know.[AN]
I told him that if he let Cythes pass[N]
uninhibited, I would leave and take[N]
you with me[Beat] He didn't try to stop me,[AN]
and he didn't try to persuade me that[N]
vassalhood was all Decia could achieve.[AN]
He merely asked if he could hold you,[N]
one last time before I took you away.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Do you[Beat] Do you think he could have[N]
changed his mind, if he knew where[N]
we would be now? That we would win?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I can never know, Iskra. None of us[N]
can predict where our paths will lead.[AN]
All we can do is make our choices[N]
and hope we won't regret them.[N]
I made mine.[A] He made his.[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
Yeah[Beat] You're right.[N]
Besides, we're not done yet![AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
No, we're not. And even when we are,[N]
Decia will still have need of us.[AN]
That includes you now, Iskra.[AN]
Your magical skill has surpassed that[N]
of your father's[Beat] It could prove[N]
very useful in rebuilding Decia.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]And it will, Mom. At first, I only[N]
joined the Liberators to protect you[N]
and Loewe[Beat] but now, it's different.[AN]
I'll keep fighting[Beat] I'll make sure[N]
that my father's death was not in vain![AN][X]

Hm? What is it, Emil?[AN]
[MidLeft][TwoLineBox]
What is it? We're a squad, aren't we?[N]
Shouldn't we fight together?[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
We are, but our duty as soldiers[N]

Loewe and Cleo command us all equally.[AN]
I have no more standing than you.[AN]

I wouldn't say that. We all still[N]

You're one of the founders, after all![AN]

I'm out of my element on the battlefield.[AN]
[MidLeft]
If you're [OpenQuote]out of your element,"[N]
what does that make me, captain?[AN]
After all, you had to rescue me before.[AN]

You could hardly call that thick[N]

The poor goons chasing you couldn't[N]

They sealed their own fates with that.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh, fair enough, but still,[N]
you really did save my keister![AN]
[Beat]Y'know, I don't think I ever asked,[N]
but why did you do that, anyway?[AN]
Wouldn't it have been better to have[N]
let Cytheans pick each other off[N]
and not risk your own life?[AN]

You've already saved my life once,[N]

I'm living on borrowed time.[AN]
If I die doing the right thing,[N]

then I can't complain too much.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Of all the ridiculous things[N]
I thought you might say, you've[N]
exceeded my wildest imagination.[AN]
Do you think your death alone[N]
would accomplish anything?[AN]
That one more body to the pyre[N]
will change a single thing?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Wha- Well, I don't know, maybe not.[AN]
I'm just saying, if someone[N]
did need to be sacrificed-[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I thought I made this clear, Emil.[N]
Our goal is not only to defeat the enemy.[AN]
Our goal is to survive, to savor the[N]
freedom we've won and honor the comrades[N]
lost fighting for liberation.[AN]
Death for death's sake means nothing.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I[Beat] Yes, of course, captain.[N]
You're right, but[Beat] I[Beat][N]
I can't help but feel expendable.[AN]
Unlike Cleo, I'm not a talented[N]

Would anyone really care?[AN]

[Beat]I didn't save you so that you[N]
would get yourself killed, so that[N]

Now, we've wasted enough of our time[N]

Looks like we're fighting side-by-side[N]
yet again, captain. Feels like I'm[N]

[MidRight]
Hm[Beat] Not quite, but you've improved.[AN]
Not as reliant on those suicidal[N]
charges of yours, at any rate.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh, right? I'm a far cry from[N]
what I was when we first met.[AN]
Maybe I can finally repay you[N]

[Beat]Speaking of, I don't think[N]
you ever told me why you did that.[AN]
Of course, if you don't want to tell[N]
me, that's fine too, but still[Beat][N]
I'd like to know, if you're willing.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Persistent, aren't you?[AN]
Well, if you're that curious,[N]
then I don't mind telling you.[AN]
You were right when you said that[N]
it made more sense to not care[N]
about the infighting of Cytheans.[AN]
At first, I was content to watch[N]
and finish off whoever survived.[AN]
But then, I heard the jeers of your[N]
pursuers and realized you fled due[N]
to your conscience, not cowardice.[AN]
[Beat]I, too, once heard cries[N]
of "traitor" from my allies,[AN]
so that spurred me to act.[AN]
[MidLeft]
H-Huh? I gotta say, it's hard[N]
to imagine anyone questioning[N]
your loyalty, captain.[AN]
[MidRight]
Although I am a founding member[N]
of the Liberators, my Selesian ties[N]
earned me significant suspicion.[AN]
Even so, Dragana trusted me enough[N]
to task me with leading a small[N]
squad in battle, to my surprise.[AN]
We fought well, for a time.[AN]
Though they initially distrusted me,[N]
our bond grew as we fought together,[N]
without so much as a single casualty.[AN]
[MidLeft]
What happened to them?[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I grew complacent. My trust[N]
in them caused me to overlook[N]
the actions of my vice-captain,[AN]
who turned out to be a Cythean spy.[AN]
When we raided a seemingly vulnerable[N]
supply depot, an ambush force met us[N]
just as we reached the supply stores[Beat][AN]
I survived and completed the mission,[N]
but I was the only one left.[AN]
After that, I asked Dragana to take[N]
away my rank and returned to my[N]
normal operations in the shadows.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's[Beat] I had no idea, captain.[N]
No wonder you wanted to fight alone.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Yes, but now, I see why those days[N]
were so important to me. In part,[N]
I have you to thank for that.[AN]
That's why[Beat] I'll almost be sad[N]
when this is all over, and you[N]
return to your home in Cythes.[AN]
You're a good soldier, Emil.[N]
[Beat]And a good friend, too.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]About that, captain.[AN]
I was thinking, what if I stick[N]
around for a little while?[AN]

Hm? What for?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Well, it's not like Decia's gonna[N]
be all good after we're done, right?[AN]

The people need a strong but wise[N]

[MidRight]
Well, you're the most senior member[N]
of the Liberators remaining,[N]

Most of them directed their complaints[N]

since our group was off in Mahemen.[AN]
Why not take the job yourself?[AN]

Hm[Beat] No, it shouldn't be my choice.[N]
The people should have say in who,[N]

And as much as I'd like to, taking[N]

Perhaps we can form a council of peers,[N]
